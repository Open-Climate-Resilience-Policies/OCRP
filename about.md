# About OCRaP.net

## The Mission: Radical Competence

We know what it looks like. We know what it sounds like.

OCRaP.net started because looking at the state of climate legislation often makes us say, "Oh, crap."

We saw Climate Action Plans citing dead links. We saw zoning codes based on outdated science. We saw critical mandates diluted by "weasel words" until they meant nothing.

We realized that the biggest threat to our future isn't just bad ideology—it's bad engineering.

We built this platform to cut through the noise. We use advanced AI, archival tools, and open-source intelligence to help you move governance from "Trust Us" to "Verify Everything."

## The Integrity Engine

We don't deal in "Truths" (which are debated) or "Facts" (which are politicized). We deal in Science and Integrity.

Our platform operates on a "Value Stack" that ensures every policy is sturdy enough for you to build a future on:

| The Layer | The Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| 1. The Science | Does it work? Our AI agents help you cross-reference every claim against peer-reviewed studies. If the physics doesn't work, the policy doesn't pass. |
| 2. The Life | Does it help? We strip away the jargon and frame policy as upgrades to human health, time, and community resilience. |
| 3. The Business | Does it pay? We prove the economic case and show how "Green Tape" is cheaper and less risky than the Red Tape of the status quo. |

## The Team

We are a coalition of the willing: developers, strategists, and—most importantly—You.

**Mike Gifford** — Chief Technology Officer (CTO)

The Architect of the Archive. Mike builds the machines that keep the system honest: open-source tools, the "Integrity Engine" scrapers, and preservation bots that ensure no government can "stealth edit" commitments. If a link is dead, Mike’s code has probably revived it via the Wayback Machine.

**Adam Hunt** — Chief Content Strategist

The Voice of the Rebellion. Adam translates "legalese" into human arguments. He turns dry zoning codes into compelling, science-backed narratives that win votes.

**You** — Citizen Lobbyist

The Engine of Change. The AI can find the error, but only you can stand up in a City Council meeting and demand it be fixed. You are the reason we built this platform.

## Wait, what does the name mean?

**nacronym** — noun | /næk-rə-nɪm/

A lexical construct that masquerades as an acronym but holds no allegiance to specific words. A sequence of capital letters designed to provoke the question, "Wait, what does that stand for?" only to be met with a shrug. Not-An-Acronym. See also: Backronym's rebellious cousin.

## Our Philosophy

- **Open Source (AGPL):** Because the code for our survival shouldn't be proprietary.
- **Open Science:** Because data behind a paywall isn't data—it's a rumor.
- **No Camps:** We don't care about your political tribe. We care about your citations.
