# OCRaP.ai (Open Climate Resilience Policies AI)

> **Stop reading policy. Start debugging it.**

**OCRaP.ai** is an open-source intelligence platform that verifies, archives, and democratizes climate legislation. We verify "Green" claims against hard science, economic reality, and legal precedent.

### ❓ What does OCRaP stand for?
It’s a **nacronym** (*noun*): A lexical construct that masquerades as an acronym but holds no allegiance to specific words. It started because looking at the state of legislative drafting made us say, *"Oh, crap."*

### 🏗️ The Architecture

We don't rely on "Trust." We rely on the **Integrity Engine**.

1.  **The Science Layer (The Physicist):**
    * **Task:** Cross-references policy claims against peer-reviewed studies (IPCC, WHO).
    * **Goal:** If the physics doesn't work, the policy doesn't pass.
2.  **The Business Layer (The CFO):**
    * **Task:** Stress-tests policies for supply chain reality, ROI, and investment risk.
    * **Goal:** Replace "Red Tape" with "Green Tape" (efficiency).
3.  **The Archival Layer (The Time Machine):**
    * **Task:** Automatically saves every cited URL to the Wayback Machine.
    * **Goal:** Prevent "Link Rot" and stealth edits by future administrations.
