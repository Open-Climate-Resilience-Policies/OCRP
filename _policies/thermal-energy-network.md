## Overview

Replacing gas boilers with air-source heat pumps one-by-one is essential but creates a massive winter peak load on the electric grid. The "Volts" approach emphasizes **Networked Geothermal** (GeoGrids). By connecting buildings with water pipes, we can harvest waste heat from supermarkets, data centers, or the ground itself, reducing electric demand by ~40% compared to air-source heat pumps.

This policy creates a **Clean Heat Standard (CHS)**, forcing gas utilities to reduce emissions, and gives them the legal path to become "Thermal Utilities"—selling hot water instead of gas.

## Policy 1: The "Clean Heat Standard" (CHS)

**Concept:**
Just as a "Renewable Portfolio Standard" forced electric utilities to buy wind/solar, a CHS forces gas utilities to deliver "Clean Heat credits."

**The Policy:**
1.  **The Credit Market:** Gas providers must retire "Clean Heat Credits" equivalent to a rising percentage of their sales (e.g., 4% reduction per year).
2.  **How to Earn Credits:** Credits are earned by:
    * Weatherizing homes (insulation).
    * Installing Heat Pumps (electrification).
    * Building **Thermal Energy Networks** (replacing gas pipes with geo-loops).
3.  **The "Alternative Compliance Payment":** If the utility fails to meet the target, they pay a massive fine into a "Low-Income Electrification Fund."

**Real-World Example:**
* **Vermont (Affordable Heat Act):** Passed in 2023, this establishes a Clean Heat Standard that requires fossil fuel importers to pay for clean heat measures, effectively creating a market mechanism to fund heat pumps.

## Policy 2: The "Thermal Energy Network" (TEN) Authorization

**Concept:**
Current laws often force utilities to fix old gas pipes even if they are obsolete. This policy allows them to abandon the gas pipe and replace it with a "Thermal Loop."

**The Policy:**
1.  **"Obligation to Serve" Update:** The legal requirement to provide "gas" is amended to a requirement to provide "thermal comfort." This allows a utility to swap a gas line for a geothermal loop without being sued.
2.  **The "Leak-Prone Pipe" Trigger:** Any street scheduled for gas pipe replacement (due to leaks/age) must first undergo a **Feasibility Study** for a Thermal Energy Network. If the TEN is cost-competitive over 30 years, the gas pipe **must** be decommissioned.
3.  **Waste Heat Rights:** Municipalities grant TEN operators the "Right of First Refusal" to capture waste heat from sewers, data centers, and subway tunnels.

**Real-World Example:**
* **New York (Utility Thermal Energy Network and Jobs Act):** Passed in 2022, this law explicitly authorizes utilities to own and operate thermal networks, preserving union jobs (pipefitters) while transitioning off gas.
* **Framingham, Massachusetts:** The local utility (Eversource) installed a neighborhood geothermal loop connecting homes, a fire station, and low-income housing, proving the "gas-to-geo" transition works.

## Policy 3: The "All-ACs-Are-Heat-Pumps" Rule

**Concept:**
A "Cooling Only" air conditioner is just a broken heat pump. The hardware is 95% identical; it just lacks a reversing valve.

**The Policy:**
1.  **The Reversing Valve Mandate:** Effective immediately, no central air conditioning unit may be sold or installed unless it includes a reversing valve (making it a two-way heat pump).
    * *Why?* The cost difference is negligible (<$200 manufacturing cost). This ensures that every time an AC breaks, the home accidentally gets a backup heater, reducing gas reliance without a "ban".
