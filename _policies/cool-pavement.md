## Overview

As climate change intensifies, the "Urban Heat Island" (UHI) effect turns cities into kilns, often 10°F+ hotter than surrounding areas. While green roofs cool private buildings, the public realm (streets and sidewalks) remains a massive thermal battery.

This policy addresses the **"Public Heat Gap"** by cooling the streets themselves, protecting vulnerable tenants indoors, and ensuring the safety of the municipal workforce. It integrates **winter-resilient permeable technologies** to ensure cooling does not compromise stormwater management or cold-weather durability.

## Policy 1: The "Cool & Porous" Paving Mandate

**Concept:**
Dark asphalt absorbs up to 95% of sunlight, radiating it back as heat all night. This policy swaps that "thermal battery" for a "thermal mirror" that also manages water.

**The Policy:**
1.  **The Albedo Standard:** All new public road resurfacing and municipal parking lots must use materials with a **Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) > 30%** (e.g., light-colored sealants or concrete).
    * *Target:* Proven to lower surface temperatures by 10–12°F.
2.  **Permeable "Sponge" Zones:** To reduce storm sewer pressure, 100% of **non-arterial** surfaces (parking lanes, alleys, sidewalks) must use **Permeable Interlocking Concrete Pavers (PICP)** or Porous Asphalt.
    * *Winter Support:* Permeable systems reduce "black ice" formation because meltwater drains instantly rather than pooling and refreezing, reducing the need for salt by up to 70%.

**Real-World Example:**
* **Phoenix, Arizona:** The "Cool Pavement Pilot" coated 36 miles of roads with "CoolSeal," reducing surface temperatures by 12°F at noon and 2.4°F at sunrise, effectively breaking the nightly heat retention cycle.
* **Los Angeles, California:** Found that reflective coatings reduced ambient air temperatures by up to 2.1°F during extreme heat events.

## Policy 2: The "Right to Cool" (Inverse Heating Standard)

**Concept:**
Cities legally mandate a *minimum* temperature in winter (e.g., 21°C) to prevent freezing. As heat waves become the deadlier threat, this policy establishes the inverse: a *maximum* safe temperature.

**The Policy:**
1.  **Maximum Indoor Threshold:** Landlords must ensure rental units do not exceed **26°C (79°F)**. If passive cooling fails, they must provide active cooling (A/C) or a designated "Cool Room" accessible to all tenants.
2.  **The "Vital Service" Definition:** Cooling is legally reclassified as a "Vital Service" (like water or heat), meaning it cannot be shut off for non-payment during proclaimed Heat Emergencies.

**Real-World Example:**
* **Dallas, Texas:** Mandates that rentals must be coolable to 85°F (29°C) or 20°F below the outside temperature.
* **Toronto, Canada:** Proposed a bylaw requiring landlords to maintain a maximum of 26°C, mirroring their long-standing winter heating requirement.

## Policy 3: Heat-Triggered Labor Protections

**Concept:**
Outdoor workers face acute mortality risks during wet-bulb spikes. Standard "air temp" readings are dangerous because they ignore humidity.

**The Policy:**
1.  **The Wet-Bulb Trigger:** Labor protections are triggered by **Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)**, not just dry air temperature, as WBGT accounts for humidity, wind, and sun angle.
2.  **Mandatory Work/Rest Ratios:**
    * **WBGT > 28°C (82°F):** 15 minutes of rest per hour.
    * **WBGT > 30°C (86°F):** 30 minutes of rest per hour (Work/Rest 30/30).
    * **WBGT > 32°C (90°F):** Stop work for non-critical tasks.
3.  **"Shade & Water" Right:** Employers must provide shaded break areas within a 2-minute walk of the worksite and cool potable water at all times.

**Real-World Example:**
* **OSHA / NIOSH Standards:** The policy strictly adopts the "Acclimatized vs. Unacclimatized" work limits used by federal safety bodies to prevent heat stroke.

## Technical Considerations: Winter & Water

Addressing the concern that "Cool Pavement" might be fragile in winter or cause flooding:

| Challenge | Solution | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Porous roads clog/freeze."** | **Vacuum Maintenance:** Cities must own "Regenerative Air Sweepers" to vacuum dust from pores biannually. **Freeze-Thaw:** Permeable pavements actually *survive* freeze-thaw better than asphalt because the voids allow ice to expand without cracking the surface. | **UNH Stormwater Center:** Research confirms porous asphalt remains permeable even when frozen, as long as vacuumed. |
| **"White roads are blinding."** | **Grey, Not White:** The standard requires an SRI of 30-40% (light grey), not 80% (white). This avoids the "snow blindness" glare for drivers while still reflecting heat. | **Phoenix Pilot:** Using "Titanium Dioxide" grey coatings balanced reflectivity with driver safety/glare concerns. |
| **"Plows destroy them."** | **Rubber-Tipped Plows:** Municipal fleets must fit plows with rubber edges or "shoes" that hover 1/4" above permeable pavers to prevent snagging. | **Toronto Green P:** Successfully maintains permeable lots using modified plow protocols. |

## Todo: Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Standards (Months 1-6)
- [ ] **Labor Contract Update:** Insert the "WBGT Work/Rest Schedule" into the collective bargaining agreement for municipal workers.
- [ ] **Purchasing Shift:** Update the Department of Transportation's "Approved Materials List" to ban black asphalt sealants, replacing them with SRI >30% alternatives.

### Phase 2: The Pilot (Months 6-12)
- [ ] **"Cool Corridor" Selection:** Identify one arterial road in a high-heat vulnerability neighborhood. Resurface it with Cool Seal and install air temperature sensors at 3ft and 6ft heights.
- [ ] **Landlord Education:** Send "Notice of Future Compliance" to all rental license holders regarding the upcoming 26°C cap.

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Integration (Year 2+)
- [ ] **The "Sponge" Retrofit:** Divert 10% of the stormwater capital budget to repaving parking lanes with Permeable Pavers (PICP).
- [ ] **Enforcement:** Code Enforcement officers begin random spot-checks of rental units during heat alerts (temperatures >30°C).
