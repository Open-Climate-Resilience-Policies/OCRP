## Overview

Gas stoves emit Nitrogen Dioxide (NOx) and Benzene inside homes, often reaching levels that would be illegal outdoors. Children in homes with gas stoves have a **42% higher risk** of asthma symptoms. This policy frames electrification as a **Public Health intervention** rather than just a climate one.

## Policy 1: The "Breathable Kitchen" Standard

**Concept:**
We regulate lead paint and asbestos; we must regulate indoor combustion.

**The Policy:**
1.  **New Construction Ban:** No new residential or commercial permits shall be issued for buildings with gas line connections to kitchens (Cooking) or laundry rooms (Drying).
2.  **Commercial Kitchen Variance:** Restaurants may apply for a "Specialty Cooking Variance" (e.g., for woks/char-broilers) only if they install **hospital-grade ventilation** and carbon monoxide sensors, paid for by a "Combustion Permit Fee."
3.  **The "Impulse" Incentive:** Offer specific rebates for **Battery-Integrated Induction Stoves** (like Impulse Labs). These plug into standard 120V outlets, avoiding the need for expensive electrical panel upgrades (240V) that usually block renters from switching.

**Real-World Example:**
* **Berkeley & New York City:** Both have passed bans on gas hookups in new construction, driven largely by the health evidence regarding childhood asthma.

## Policy 2: The "Burner Replacement" Notification

**Concept:**
Most people replace their water heater or stove in a panic when it breaks. They buy what is in stock (usually gas).

**The Policy:**
1.  **Point-of-Sale Warning:** Retailers must display "Health Warning" labels on gas stoves (similar to cigarettes) regarding asthma risks.
2.  **Emergency Replacement Reserve:** The City establishes a "Heat Pump Water Heater Reserve." When a resident's gas water heater dies, they can get an immediate, subsidized electric replacement from the city reserve within 24 hours, preventing the "panic purchase" of a new gas unit.
