## Overview



Cities often break nature into small, isolated pieces. Roads and concrete block animals from moving, mating, or finding food. This policy creates **Biodiversity Corridors**—safe pathways that physically reconnect these pieces.

By weaving nature back into the city, we solve three problems at once: we save local animals (like bees and frogs), we stop floods by giving rain somewhere to go, and we cool down our overheated neighborhoods.

## Policy 1: The "Living Infrastructure" Mandate

**Concept:**
Cities are full of small structures—bus stops, trash bins, and bike sheds—that have empty roofs. We can use these surfaces to create a "highway" for insects.

**The Policy:**
All new and renovated small public structures must have a "green roof" planted with moss, sedum, or wildflowers.
* **Scope:** Bus shelters, utility boxes, and bike storage lockers.
* **Goal:** To give bees and butterflies a place to rest and feed as they travel across the concrete city.

**Why It Works:**
* **Uses No Extra Space:** It uses roofs that already exist.
* **Cleans the Air:** The plants trap dust and pollution.
* **Cools the Street:** Metal roofs get hot; green roofs stay cool.

**Real-World Example:**
* **Utrecht, Netherlands:** The city transformed over 300 bus stops into [**"Bee Stops"**](https://www.utrecht.nl/city-of-utrecht/green-roofed-bus-shelters-in-utrecht) with green roofs. The project saved the local bee population and is paid for by the advertising company that manages the stops, costing the city nothing.



## Policy 2: Urban Stream "Daylighting"

**Concept:**
In the 20th century, many cities buried natural creeks inside concrete pipes to build parking lots or roads on top. This caused flooding and killed the fish. "Daylighting" means digging them up and letting them flow in the open again.

**The Policy:**
The City will adopt a **"Daylighting" Zoning Code**. When a developer wants to rebuild a site that has a buried pipe, they must check if it can be uncovered and restored to a natural stream.

**Why It Works:**
* **Flood Control:** Natural streams absorb heavy rain like a sponge; pipes just overflow.
* **Natural Air Conditioning:** Open water cools the air around it, lowering the ["Urban Heat Island"](https://www.epa.gov/heatisland) effect.

**Real-World Example:**
* **Seoul, South Korea:** The city tore down a major highway to uncover the **[Cheonggyecheon Stream](https://www.landscapeperformance.org/case-study-briefs/cheonggyecheon-stream-restoration-project)**. It lowered the temperature of the area by nearly 6°C and brought back fish and birds that hadn't been seen for decades.



## Policy 3: The Ecological Link (Wildlife Bridges)

**Concept:**
Highways are deadly walls for nature. Animals cannot cross them to find mates, leading to inbreeding and extinction.

**The Policy:**
The City will require **"Eco-Links"** (green bridges or tunnels) whenever a major road cuts through a forest or nature reserve.
* **Design:** The bridge must be covered in soil and trees, so animals think they are just walking through the woods.

**Why It Works:**
* **Genetic Health:** It allows isolated animal families to meet and mix, which keeps the population healthy.
* **Road Safety:** It creates fewer car accidents involving deer or other wildlife.

**Real-World Example:**
* **Singapore:** The **[Eco-Link@BKE](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/visit/parks/bukit-timah-nature-reserve/special-features/eco-link-bke)** connects two rainforests separated by an expressway. Rare animals like the Sunda Pangolin now use it safely to expand their territory.



## Todo: Implementation Roadmap

If you are a city planner or council member, follow these steps to get started.

### Phase 1: The Audit (Months 1-3)
- [ ] **Map the "Blue Lines":** Use old historical maps to find where streams were buried under the city.
- [ ] **Map the "Kill Zones":** Ask the Department of Transportation for data on where the most animal-vehicle collisions happen. This is where you need a Wildlife Bridge.
- [ ] **Identify "Grey" Assets:** Count how many city-owned bus stops and utility kiosks could support a green roof.

### Phase 2: The Pilot (Months 3-6)
- [ ] **Launch the "Bee Stop" Pilot:** Put out a contract (RFP) for new bus shelters that requires green roofs. (Tip: Ask advertising companies to pay for maintenance in exchange for ad space, like Utrecht did).
- [ ] **Zoning Text Amendment:** Draft language that gives developers "bonus density" (permission to build bigger) if they agree to "daylight" a stream on their property.

### Phase 3: Major Infrastructure (Months 6-12+)
- [ ] **Grant Writing:** Apply for FEMA/Flood mitigation grants to fund Stream Daylighting projects (frame it as "flood control," not just "nature").
- [ ] **Feasibility Study:** Commission an engineering study for a Wildlife Bridge at the #1 worst roadkill location identified in Phase 1.
