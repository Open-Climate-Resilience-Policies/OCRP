## Overview

Urbanization often fragments natural habitats, isolating animal populations and disrupting ecosystems. This policy establishes a framework for **Biodiversity Corridors and Rewilding**, aiming to physically reconnect these fragmented habitats. By integrating nature into the built environment, cities can support pollinators, reduce flood risks, and lower urban temperatures.

## Policy 1: The "Living Infrastructure" Mandate

**Concept:**
Cities possess vast amounts of unused surface area on top of small public utility structures (bus stops, kiosks, electrical boxes) that can serve as critical "stepping stones" for pollinators.

**The Policy:**
Mandate that all new and retrofitted small-scale public infrastructure must be equipped with green roofs consisting of sedum plants, mosses, or native wildflowers.
*   **Scope:** Bus shelters, bike sheds, waste/recycling hubs, and utility kiosks.
*   **Goal:** Create a "micro-corridor" network for bees and butterflies in dense concrete areas where large parks are not feasible.

**Why It Works:**
*   **Zero Land Use:** Requires no additional ground space.
*   **Air Quality:** Captures fine dust and particulate matter.
*   **Water Management:** Stores rainwater, reducing runoff.
*   **Biodiversity:** Provides crucial rest stops for pollinators moving between larger green spaces.

**Real-World Example:**
*   **Utrecht, Netherlands:** Transformed over 300 bus stops into "Bee Stops" with green roofs. This initiative stabilized the local bee population and requires minimal maintenance.

## Policy 2: Urban Stream "Daylighting"

**Concept:**
Many 20th-century cities buried natural rivers and streams in concrete pipes to build roads or parking lots, destroying aquatic corridors and increasing flood risks.

**The Policy:**
Implement a **"Daylighting" Zoning Code** that prioritizes the unearthing of buried urban streams during major redevelopment projects.
*   **Requirement:** Convert paved canals or buried pipes back into open, naturalized streams with vegetated banks.

**Why It Works:**
*   **Biodiversity:** Re-establishes aquatic corridors for fish and amphibians.
*   **Cooling:** Significantly lowers the "Urban Heat Island" effect through evaporative cooling.
*   **Flood Control:** Provides natural flood management by allowing water to absorb into the soil rather than rushing into storm drains.

**Real-World Example:**
*   **Seoul, South Korea:** Removed a major highway to "daylight" the **Cheonggyecheon Stream**. The project created a massive wind corridor that cools the surrounding area by 3.3°C to 5.9°C and restored habitat for varied species of birds, fish, and insects.

## Policy 3: The Ecological Link (Wildlife Bridges)

**Concept:**
Highways and train lines often slice through existing forests, creating "habitat fragmentation" where animals cannot mate, hunt, or migrate without risking roadkill.

**The Policy:**
Require the construction of **"Eco-Links"** (vegetated overpasses or underpasses) whenever major transport infrastructure bisects a designated nature reserve or green belt.
*   **Design Standard:** Structures must be planted with native vegetation to mimic the surrounding forest, effectively hiding the road from the wildlife crossing it.

**Why It Works:**
*   **Genetic Health:** Physically reconnects fragmented forests, allowing for genetic exchange between isolated animal populations (preventing inbreeding).
*   **Safety:** Reduces dangerous animal-vehicle collisions.

**Real-World Example:**
*   **Singapore:** Constructed the **Eco-Link@BKE**, a bridge covered in dense rainforest connecting the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Rare animals like the Sunda Pangolin and Palm Civet have been observed using the bridge to expand their territories.

## Implementation Strategy

1.  **Audit:** Map existing buried streams and fragmented green belts to identify high-impact opportunities.
2.  **Pilot:** Begin with the "Living Infrastructure" mandate as it has the lowest barrier to entry and high visibility.
3.  **Partnership:** Collaborate with transport authorities for Eco-Links and water management agencies for Daylighting projects.
