## Overview

Sending food scraps to landfills is a double disaster: it generates methane (a greenhouse gas 80x more potent than CO2) and permanently removes nutrients from the soil cycle. 

This policy establishes a **"Soil-to-Soil" Cycle**. It makes it illegal to landfill organic waste, mandates the infrastructure to collect it ("Brown Bins"), and legally requires the resulting compost to be returned to the local ecosystem rather than sold as a commodity.

## Policy 1: The Landfill Ban (The "Vermont Rule")

**Concept:**
Voluntary composting achieves low participation rates. To reach critical mass, organic waste must be legally classified as a "recylable resource," not trash.

**The Policy:**
Effective immediately, **Organic Waste** (food scraps, yard trimmings, soiled paper) is banned from the general refuse stream (Black Bins).
* **Phased Rollout:**
    * *Year 1:* Large generators (supermarkets, universities, stadiums).
    * *Year 2:* All residential and commercial buildings.
* **Enforcement:** Waste haulers are prohibited from picking up Black Bins that contain visible organic matter. Repeated violations result in fines for the *building owner*, not the tenant (incentivizing landlords to provide infrastructure).

**Real-World Example:**
* **Vermont, USA (Act 148):** The first U.S. state to ban food scraps from trash entirely. This led to a 48% increase in residential food scrap separation and the creation of local composting jobs.

## Policy 2: The Infrastructure Mandate (The "Milan Model")

**Concept:**
Bans only work if collection is easy and sanitary. The "Yuck Factor" (smells, leaks) is the #1 barrier to adoption.

**The Policy:**
1.  **Universal "Brown Bins":** Every residential unit must be issued a sealable, animal-proof curb-side container.
2.  **The "Kitchen Caddy" Standard:** The City will provide free vented kitchen pails and a starting supply of **compostable bioplastic liners** to every household.
    * *Why Vented?* Contrary to intuition, vented pails allow moisture to evaporate, which reduces the anaerobic rot that causes smells.
3.  **High-Frequency Collection:** Brown Bins (Organics) are collected **weekly**, while Black Bins (Trash) are reduced to **bi-weekly** collection. This incentivizes residents to move putrescible waste into the Brown Bin to get it off their property faster.

**Real-World Example:**
* **Milan, Italy:** By using vented bins and compostable bags, Milan achieved one of the highest food waste collection rates in Europe (62%+) in a dense urban environment.

## Policy 3: Closing the Loop (The Soil Dividend)

**Concept:**
Compost is often sold to remote industrial farms. This policy keeps the value local.

**The Policy:**
1.  **The "Parks First" Rule:** The Department of Parks & Recreation is mandated to use city-generated compost for 100% of its landscaping needs, banning the purchase of chemical nitrogen fertilizers.
2.  **Farm Partnerships:** Local farms within a 50km radius receive compost free of charge if they agree to participate in a "Carbon Farming" soil-monitoring program.

**Real-World Example:**
* **San Francisco, USA:** The city collects 500 tons of organics daily. The resulting compost is used by local vineyards in Napa Valley, which then grow the food/wine sold back to the city, creating a true regional loop.

## Addressing the "Flies & Rats" Objection

The most common public opposition to organic waste policies is the fear of increased pests. This policy mitigates those risks through specific technical mandates:

| Concern | Mitigation Strategy | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"It will attract rats."** | **Animal-Proof Design:** Brown bins must feature locking lids (gravity locks that open only when tipped by a truck). **No Plastic Bags:** Banning standard plastic bags prevents "bag ripping" by scavengers. | **South Korea:** Uses RFID-locked bins that only open for residents, effectively sealing waste from street pests. |
| **"It will smell/breed flies."** | **The "Freezer Trick":** Education campaigns teach residents to freeze meat/fish scraps in a paper bag until collection day. **Weekly Pickup:** By collecting organics more often than trash, the breeding cycle of flies (approx. 7-10 days) is broken *before* hatching occurs. | **Milan:** High-frequency collection (twice weekly) prevents the fermentation phase that attracts flies. |
| **"It's messy/leaky."** | **Bio-Liners:** Mandating the use of certified compostable liners ensures the "mess" stays in the bag, keeping the bin clean. | **Vermont:** Act 148 compliance data shows "yuck factor" drops significantly when liners are permitted. |

## Todo: Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Setup (Months 1-6)
- [ ] **Procurement:** Issue RFP for "Brown Bins" with gravity locks and vented kitchen caddies.
- [ ] **Ordinance Passage:** Pass the "Organic Waste Ban" with a 12-month grace period.
- [ ] **Pilot Zone:** Select one high-density neighborhood for the rollout to test collection routes.

### Phase 2: The Rollout (Months 6-12)
- [ ] **"Bin Drop":** Distribute bins and starter kits (liners + educational fridge magnet) to all residents.
- [ ] **The "Pay-As-You-Throw" Switch:** Introduce RFID weighing on trash bins (optional) or simply reduce trash pickup frequency to bi-weekly.
- [ ] **Enforcement Warning Phase:** "Oops" stickers placed on trash bins that contain food waste, warning of future fines.

### Phase 3: The Loop (Year 2+)
- [ ] **Fertilizer Ban:** Formally ban the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers on all city property, replacing it with the new municipal compost supply.
- [ ] **Impact Audit:** Measure the reduction in methane at the local landfill and the carbon sequestration levels in local park soils.
