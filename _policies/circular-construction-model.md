## Overview

The construction sector is historically a linear economy ("take, make, dispose"), contributing significantly to landfill mass and embodied carbon emissions. This policy establishes a **Circular Construction Model** for [City/Organization Name].

By shifting from "demolition" to "deconstruction," the policy aims to:
*   **Minimize Waste:** Divert usable building materials (wood, brick, glass, metals) from landfills.
*   **Preserve Embodied Carbon:** Retain the energy already spent extracting and manufacturing materials, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of new projects.
*   **Foster Innovation:** Encourage the local green economy through salvage and resale markets.

**Background Context:** This policy mimics successful frameworks like that of **Amsterdam, Netherlands**, which targets 100% circularity by 2050. Their use of "Material Passports" ensures buildings are treated as material banks for the future.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
*   All commercial and residential development projects exceeding **1,000 sq. ft.**
*   All municipal capital improvement projects.
*   Any project seeking a permit for total or partial removal of a structure.

## Key Definitions

*   **Deconstruction:** The systematic dismantling of a structure, specifically to maximize the recovery of materials for reuse and recycling.
*   **Demolition:** The destructive removal of buildings, typically resulting in commingled waste sent to landfills.
*   **Material Passport:** A digital document listing all materials, components, and products used in a building to facilitate future recovery and reuse.

## Policy Requirements

### 1. The "Deconstruction First" Mandate

Effective immediately, the Department of Buildings will no longer issue standard Demolition Permits for qualifying structures. Developers must apply for a **Deconstruction Permit**.

*   **Requirement:** Applicants must submit a **Deconstruction Plan** detailing how the building will be dismantled.
*   **Salvage Targets:** Projects must achieve a minimum diversion rate of **70% by weight** (excluding hazardous materials) through reuse or recycling.

### 2. Material Recovery Process

*   **Soft Strip:** Non-structural elements (doors, cabinets, fixtures, flooring) must be removed first and sent to reuse centers.
*   **Structural Dismantling:** Structural elements (bricks, lumber, steel beams) must be separated at the source.
*   **Verification:** Receipts from salvage yards or donation centers must be submitted to close out the permit.

### 3. Material Passports for New Construction

To ensure future circularity, all new construction projects must file a "Material Passport" prior to receiving a Certificate of Occupancy.
*   The passport must document the identity, location, and recycling potential of materials used.
*   This data must be accessible to future owners to facilitate easier maintenance and eventual deconstruction.

## Implementation & Compliance

| Phase | Timeline | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | Months 1-6 | Voluntary compliance; Municipal pilot projects. |
| **Phase 2** | Months 7-12 | Mandatory for all commercial buildings > 5,000 sq. ft. |
| **Phase 3** | Month 13+ | Mandatory for all residential and commercial projects. |

### Non-Compliance Penalties

Failure to adhere to the Deconstruction Plan or meet salvage targets will result in:
*   **Fines:** Calculated based on the weight of unsalvaged material sent to landfills.
*   **Permit Holds:** Suspension of future building permits for the developer until fines are paid.
