# Cohousing & Cooperative Housing Resource-Sharing Mandate

## Summary
A municipal framework to incentivize **Cohousing** and **Housing Cooperatives (Co-ops)** as a primary strategy for climate resilience. This policy leverages "radical resource sharing" to decarbonize the housing sector while addressing the affordability crisis. It shifts the focus from "energy-efficient independent units" to "resource-efficient communities."

## The Problem
* **Inefficient Consumption:** The standard housing model relies on individual ownership of rarely used assets (lawnmowers, guest rooms, large private kitchens), resulting in high embodied carbon and waste.
* **Social Isolation:** Fragmented living arrangements contribute to a loneliness epidemic, weakening community resilience during climate shocks (e.g., heat waves, floods).
* **Zoning Barriers:** Current codes penalize shared living by mandating excessive private amenities and parking, making co-living illegal or financially unviable.

## The Solution: A "Share-Shed" Zoning Overlay
Municipalities shall adopt a **Cohousing Overlay Zone** applicable to all residential areas. This overlay incentivizes density and affordability in exchange for verifiable resource sharing.

### 1. The "Share-Shed" Requirement
Developments qualify for this overlay only if they reduce private footprint in favor of shared assets:
* **Common House Mandate:** Minimum 15% of gross floor area must be dedicated to communal use (commercial-grade kitchen, dining hall, workshops).
* **The "Library of Things":** Mandatory shared infrastructure for high-carbon tools (laundry, woodworking, gardening equipment) to negate the need for private ownership.
* **Guest Room Banking:** Private units are permitted to be smaller (micro-units) by pooling guest accommodations into shared, bookable suites.

### 2. Legal & Financial Enablers
* **Zoning for "Functional Families":** Amend definitions of "household" to allow unlimited unrelated individuals to live together if they function as a single economic unit (removing "roommate caps").
* **Community Land Trust (CLT) Partnership:** City-owned surplus land is offered first to CLTs or Co-ops on long-term nominal leases ($1/year), removing land cost speculation.
* **Density Bonuses:** Exclude shared amenity spaces from Floor Area Ratio (FAR) calculations.

## Municipal Precedents: Examples Folks Can Work For

These real-world examples prove that this model works. Advocates can use these case studies to show city councils what is possible.

### 1. Amsterdam, Netherlands: The "Zelfbouw" (Self-Build) Model
* **The Policy:** The city designates specific plots of land *exclusively* for "CPO" (Collectief Particulier Opdrachtgeverschap) groups—essentially citizen-led housing co-ops. These groups do not compete with commercial developers; they only compete with other community groups based on the quality of their social and environmental plans.
* **The Result:** Projects like **De Warren**, a carbon-positive co-op built by its residents. It features a massive shared "energy facade," communal thermal storage, and 30% shared living space, reducing rent significantly below market rates.
* **Actionable Takeaway:** Demand your city set aside a percentage of public land sales strictly for non-profit/citizen groups, judging bids on *social value* rather than highest price.

### 2. Vancouver, Canada: Community Land Trust (CLT) Partnerships
* **The Policy:** The City of Vancouver has leased municipal land (valued at over $100M) to the **Community Land Trust Foundation of BC** for 99 years at a nominal rate. This allows the CLT to build and operate mixed-income co-ops where residents pay no more than 30% of their income.
* **The Result:** 58 affordable homes at 1700 Kingsway and other sites. By removing the land cost from the equation, the co-op model becomes financially viable even in one of the world's most expensive real estate markets.
* **Actionable Takeaway:** Push for a "Public Land for Public Good" bylaw that mandates surplus city property be transferred to a Land Trust rather than sold to private developers.

### 3. Kingston, Ontario: Zoning for "Invisible Density"
* **The Policy:** While still evolving, Kingston has seen a rise in "forming groups" like **Kingston Cohousing** and existing success with **Kingston Co-operative Homes**. The city is exploring zoning reforms to allow "missing middle" density (fourplexes, cluster housing) in traditionally single-family areas.
* **The Opportunity:** Advocates in mid-sized cities like Kingston are using the "climate emergency" declaration to argue that cohousing is a climate strategy, not just a housing strategy.
* **Actionable Takeaway:** Use the "Cluster Housing" argument—zoning that allows multiple smaller detached units on a single large lot (a "cottage court") without subdividing the land, sharing a common driveway and garden.

### 4. Vienna, Austria: The "Social Mix" Gold Standard
* **The Policy:** In new developments over a certain size, **two-thirds** of the floor space must be subsidized housing. The city uses a "quality competition" (Bauträgerwettbewerbe) where developers win based on four pillars: Economics, Architecture, Ecology, and **Social Sustainability**.
* **The Result:** "Social Sustainability" is a scoring metric. Developers *must* propose how residents will interact, share resources, and self-manage. This effectively mandates the "community building" aspect of cohousing into all social housing.
* **Actionable Takeaway:** Ask your planning department to add a "Social Sustainability" scoring matrix to all Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for city-supported housing.

## Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Action Item |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate** | **Audit Surplus Land:** Identify 3 city-owned parcels suitable for a pilot Co-op/CLT partnership. |
| **Year 1** | **Pass "Co-Living" Overlay:** Remove caps on unrelated occupants and reduce parking minimums for developments with car-share programs. |
| **Year 2** | **Establish Revolving Loan Fund:** Create a seed fund to help co-op groups pay for initial architectural drawings and legal fees (often the biggest barrier to entry). |
