## Overview

Moving from house-by-house retrofits to a street-by-street or neighborhood-wide approach dramatically lowers costs through economies of scale, ensures quality control, and builds social momentum. This policy establishes the **Community Retrofit Aggregation & Financing Tool (CRAFT)**, a framework designed to support communities in bulk-buying retrofits with integrated financing.

## 1. Core Mechanism: The "Aggregator" Entity

The central policy innovation is the formal designation and funding of **Retrofit Aggregators**. Instead of individual homeowners managing contractors, an Aggregator manages the process for a whole group (e.g., 50–500 homes at a time).

**Who can be an Aggregator?**
*   **Municipalities:** (e.g., "City Retrofit Office")
*   **Non-Profits/Co-ops:** Community energy cooperatives or housing non-profits.
*   **Neighborhood Associations:** With a registered legal structure.

**Role of the Aggregator:**
*   Recruits households to sign a non-binding "Expression of Interest."
*   Issues bulk Tenders/RFPs to contractors for specifically scoped work (e.g., "Install 50 heat pumps in the Cedar Heights neighborhood").
*   Oversees quality assurance and acts as the project manager.

## 2. Bulk Buying & Delivery Strategy

To maximize savings and speed, the policy divides retrofits into standardized "streams":

| Stream | Bulk Buy Opportunity | Efficiency Gain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. The Thermal Shell** | Bulk purchase of insulation materials (cellulose, spray foam) and air-sealing labor. | Contractors can do 3-4 attics a day if homes are adjacent, reducing travel/setup costs by 15-20%. |
| **B. The Mechanical Switch** | Bulk purchase of Heat Pumps and Heat Pump Water Heaters. | Wholesale equipment pricing (direct from manufacturer) and standardized installation teams. |
| **C. Energy Independence** | Bulk purchase of Solar PV panels and Battery Storage systems. | "Solarize" model: Group discount tiers (e.g., "If 50 homes sign up, price drops by 10%"). |

## 3. Integrated Financing Models

The policy solves the "upfront cost" barrier by attaching financing to the property, not the person.

### Option A: PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy)
*   **How it works:** The Aggregator (or finance authority) pays the upfront cost.
*   **Repayment:** Homeowner repays via a line item on their property tax bill over 15–20 years.
*   **Benefit:** If the homeowner sells, the remaining balance stays with the house (new owner benefits from savings and takes over payments).

### Option B: On-Bill Financing (OBF)
*   **How it works:** The local utility provider pays the contractor.
*   **Repayment:** Homeowner repays via their monthly electricity/gas bill.
*   **Constraint:** The monthly loan payment must be less than the estimated energy savings (Bill Neutrality).

## 4. Government Support & De-Risking

To enable this model, the government provides:
*   **Seed Funding:** Grants to cover administrative setup costs for Aggregators (legal fees, project manager salaries).
*   **Loan Guarantees:** Government guarantees bulk loans taken out by the Aggregator, lowering interest rates (aiming for 0-2%).
*   **Standardized Contracts:** Providing "off-the-shelf" legal contracts for bulk purchasing to protect communities from liability.

## 5. Implementation Pilot: "The Street-by-Street Challenge"

A pilot program to launch the policy:
1.  **Apply:** Neighborhoods apply to be a "Retrofit Zone" (Criteria: High density of similar housing types, high buy-in).
2.  **Coach:** Winning neighborhood receives a dedicated "Retrofit Coach."
3.  **Bulk Buy:** Coach organizes the bulk buy (e.g., 100 heat pumps).
4.  **Renovation Train:** Teams move through the street assembly-line style—insulation one week, heat pumps the next.

## Summary of Benefits

| Feature | Individual Approach | CRAFT (Community Bulk) Approach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Retail pricing + individual travel/setup. | **20-30% discount** via wholesale purchasing and clustered labor. |
| **Trust** | Homeowner must vet contractors alone. | **Aggregator vets contractors**; community relies on peer trust. |
| **Speed** | One home at a time; scheduling delays. | **Assembly-line delivery**; teams move door-to-door. |
| **Grid** | Random installs strain the grid. | Coordinated battery installs can form a **Virtual Power Plant (VPP)**. |
