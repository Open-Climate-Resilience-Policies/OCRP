# The Nighttime Recovery Standard

## 1. The Core Mandate
All residential units must be capable of reaching a **Safe Recovery Temperature** of <span data-measure="temp" data-value="26">26°C</span> for at least 8 continuous hours between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM.

## 2. The Science (Why?)
Tropical nights prevent cardiovascular reset.
> "Mortality risk increases by ~10-60% during tropical nights."
> — [WHO Heat Guidelines](evidence/who-heat-health.txt)

## 3. Implementation
### 3.1 Passive First
Before mechanical cooling is installed, landlords must install **external shading** on South/West facing windows.

### 3.2 The "Cool Room" Variance
If central AC is not feasible, the landlord may designate one "Recovery Room" that meets the standard.
