# The Dynamic Design Standard Act
*Also known as: The "Stationarity is Dead" Act*

> **The Core Mandate:**
> All public infrastructure projects with a lifespan exceeding 10 years must rely on **forward-looking climate projection models** (e.g., IPCC RCP 4.5/8.5 or local equivalents) for design loads. The use of exclusively historical weather data (e.g., NOAA Atlas 14) for long-term assets is hereby classified as **Professional Negligence**.

## 1. The Value Stack (Why This Matters)

### 🧪 The Science: "Projected vs. Historical"
Engineering has traditionally relied on "Stationarity"—the idea that the future weather will look like the past. **Stationarity is dead.**
* **The Reality:** Rainfall intensity in many regions has increased by >20% since 1990.
* **The Fix:** We mandate the use of **Projected Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) Curves**. If you are building a bridge to last until 2075, you must use the projected weather of 2075, not the weather of 1990.

### ❤️ The Life: "The Dry Basement Guarantee"
* **The Pain:** Neighborhoods built in the last decade are flooding during "routine" storms because the pipes were sized for a climate that no longer exists.
* **The Promise:** By sizing drainage for the *future* storm, we protect residents from the trauma and cost of repetitive flooding.

### 💼 The Business: "The Asset Liability Shield"
* **The Risk:** If a city approves a bridge using old data and it washes away, the city (and the engineering firm) can be held liable for negligence. "Force Majeure" is no longer a valid defense when the extreme weather was predicted.
* **The ROI:** This policy is a legal shield. Designing to dynamic standards provides a defensible "Standard of Care" in court.

## 2. Implementation Mechanisms

### 2.1 The "Safety Factor" Multiplier (The Fail-Safe)
In the absence of localized, high-confidence dynamic climate models, all design calculations based on historical data must apply a **mandatory Safety Factor Multiplier**:

* **Stormwater/Drainage:** <span data-measure="multiplier" data-value="1.25">1.25x</span> historical volume.
* **Wind Load:** <span data-measure="multiplier" data-value="1.15">1.15x</span> historical velocity.
* **Heat Tolerance:** <span data-measure="multiplier" data-value="1.10">1.10x</span> historical max temp.

### 2.2 The "Living" As-Built
Infrastructure documentation cannot be a static PDF filed in a basement.
* **Requirement:** All major assets must maintain a "Digital Twin" or standardized data set of their design parameters.
* **The Re-Simulation Audit:** Every 5 years, the City Engineer must re-simulate critical assets against the *latest* climate data. If an asset falls below the safety threshold, it is automatically flagged for the Capital Improvement Budget.

## 3. Evidence & Citations

> "The assumption of stationarity in climate is no longer valid for engineering design."
> — *Milly et al., Science Magazine (2008)*

* **IPCC AR6 Working Group I:** Establishes the specific projection pathways (RCP 4.5 / 8.5) required for modeling.
* **ASCE Code of Ethics:** Requires engineers to "hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public," which implies acknowledging known climate risks.

## 🤝 For the Business Community (BIA)

**Bottom Line Impact:**
* **CapEx (Upfront Cost):** **Increases ~3-8%**. Bigger pipes and stronger concrete cost more initially.
* **OpEx (Risk Avoidance):** **Decreases significantly**. Avoiding a single catastrophic failure (bridge washout) saves 100x the initial premium.
* **Insurance:** Bond rating agencies (Moody's) are beginning to downgrade cities that do not account for climate risk. This policy protects the city's credit rating, keeping borrowing costs low for *all* businesses.

## 🗣️ The Drafting Room
*This policy is a living document. Help us break it, fix it, and pass it.*

### 🧪 Science Check
* **The Data Gap:** Do accurate "Projected IDF Curves" actually exist for your specific region? If not, is the **1.25x Multiplier** a scientifically sound proxy, or is it too blunt an instrument?
* **Model Selection:** Should we mandate RCP 8.5 (Worst Case) or RCP 4.5 (Moderate)? What is the cost difference?

### 💼 Business Reality
* **The "Gold Plating" Argument:** Developers, does this standard make housing unaffordable? Would you prefer a "Risk Disclosure" (letting buyers take the risk) over a mandate?
* **Liability:** Engineering firms, does this law protect you (by defining a standard) or expose you (by creating a higher bar)?

### 🏠 Local Life
* **The "Construction" Phase:** Larger drains mean bigger road closures during construction. Is the disruption worth the 50-year safety?
