# Waste Equity (Pay-As-You-Throw)
**Discussion Title:** [Feedback]: Fairness, Dumping, and the "Diaper Dilemma"

We are stress-testing the Waste Equity (Pay-As-You-Throw) model.

## 💼 For The City / CFO

**The "Cobra Effect":** If we charge per bag, will people start illegally dumping trash in commercial dumpsters or roadside ditches? How do we prevent this (e.g., locking bins, rapid cleanup crews)?

## 🧪 For Environmentalists

**Verification:** Does the "Recycling" stream actually get recycled, or does it go to the landfill anyway? We need an audit of the local Materials Recovery Facility (MRF).

## 🏠 For Large Families

**Fairness:** Does this policy unfairly penalize families with unavoidable waste (e.g., diapers, medical supplies)? Should there be a "Medical Variance" allowance?

***

## Draft Implementation Notes

- Pilot Pay-As-You-Throw in a small district with robust monitoring for illegal dumping.
- Create exemptions/credits for households with medical needs or large families.
- Require annual independent audits of MRF outcomes and publish diversion rates.
