## Overview

This model policy outlines requirements and incentives for installing solar canopies on large parking lots to expand distributed solar generation and reduce emissions. It provides implementers with timelines, design requirements, and enforcement options adapted from the French decree.

France's Decree No. 2024-1023, published in November 2024, establishes mandatory solar panel installations on large parking lots across the country. This groundbreaking legislation represents one of the most ambitious parking lot solar mandates globally, requiring at least 50% coverage of parking areas with solar canopies or green energy structures.

## Key Requirements

### Size Thresholds
- **Applicable to parking lots**: 1,500 square meters or larger
- **Coverage requirement**: Minimum 50% of total parking area, including traffic lanes
- **Applies to**: Both new and existing parking facilities

### Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1: Large Parking Lots**
- **Size**: Over 10,000 square meters (approximately 400+ parking spaces)
- **Deadline**: July 1, 2026

**Phase 2: Medium Parking Lots**
- **Size**: 1,500 to 10,000 square meters (approximately 60-400 parking spaces)
- **Deadline**: July 1, 2028

### Compliance and Penalties
- **Non-compliance fine**: Up to €40,000 annually
- **Duration**: Fines apply until compliance is achieved
- **Enforcement**: National environmental regulations and local inspection regimes

### Exemptions

The decree provides exemptions for parking lots where solar installations would be:
- **Technically infeasible** due to soil composition or terrain slope
- **Unsafe** due to high natural disaster risk
- **Security concerns** at sites with technological or civil security risks
- **Hazardous goods** parking areas handling dangerous materials

## Policy Context

### Legislative History
- **2022**: Initial legislation passed requiring solar coverage for parking lots with 80+ spaces
- **2024**: Updated decree (No. 2024-1023) providing detailed implementation specifications
- **Enforcement begins**: 2026 for largest facilities

### Energy Targets
This mandate supports national and regional renewable energy transition goals by adding distributed generation capacity to commercial and industrial sites. It integrates with broader energy planning by enabling local generation near demand centers and potential for behind-the-meter integration with EV charging.

## Real-World Implementation

### Corporate Response
Major retailers and commercial property owners are implementing solar parking canopies as part of capital upgrades:

**Carrefour Supermarket Chain:**
- **350 solar carport installations** planned
- **450 gigawatt hours** annual production expected
- **180,000 parking spaces** to be covered
- **First installations**: connected to grid in 2025
- **Target**: 50% completion by 2026

### Site Design Considerations
- **Structural engineering**: Canopies must be designed for local wind and snow loads
- **Bifacial panels**: Increase yield by capturing reflected irradiance from light-colored pavements
- **EV integration**: Include conduit and space for EV chargers and demand management systems

## Environmental and Economic Benefits

### Energy Generation
- **Estimated national capacity**: Several gigawatts of distributed solar
- **Local energy production**: Reduces transmission losses and supports local demand
- **Grid services**: Can integrate with storage and demand response to provide peak shaving

### Climate Impact
- **Carbon reduction**: Significant offset through renewable generation
- **Urban cooling**: Shaded parking reduces heat island effect and improves thermal comfort
- **Resilience**: Provides sheltered parking during extreme weather events

### Economic Considerations
- **Investment opportunity**: Private sector solar development
- **Property value**: Enhanced amenities for commercial properties
- **Operating costs**: Reduced electricity bills for property owners
- **Job creation**: Solar installation and maintenance employment

## Technical Specifications

### Design Requirements
- Solar canopies or photovoltaic shelters must be structurally sound and engineered for local conditions
- Green energy canopy alternatives permitted where technically equivalent
- Must cover parking spaces and traffic lanes where feasible

### Integration Considerations
- Grid connection requirements and permitting
- Energy storage options for smoothing output and providing resilience
- EV charging infrastructure: design to allow future chargers and smart load management

## Policy Model for Other Jurisdictions

France's parking lot solar mandate offers a model for other regions considering similar legislation:

### Strengths
- **Clear thresholds**: Unambiguous size requirements (1,500+ sqm)
- **Phased implementation**: Realistic timelines by parking lot size
- **Defined exemptions**: Safety and technical feasibility considerations
- **Strong enforcement**: Financial penalties encourage compliance
- **Dual benefits**: Energy generation plus vehicle/weather protection

### Adaptability
This policy model can be scaled and adapted for different climates, jurisdiction sizes, and energy goals. Local implementers should adjust the size thresholds, coverage percentages, and timelines to fit their market conditions and construction cycles.

- **Solar industry publications**: Technical implementation guides and case studies

## Implementation Guidance for Policymakers

### Key Considerations
1. **Stakeholder engagement**: Work with parking lot owners and major tenants early to identify constraints and co-financing options
2. **Technical support**: Provide engineering guidance and approved design templates to accelerate permitting
3. **Financing options**: Explore incentives, low-interest loans, or public-private partnerships
4. **Inspection protocols**: Establish clear compliance verification steps
5. **Transition periods**: Allow sufficient lead time for major installations and supply chain planning

## Monitoring and Evaluation

### Performance Metrics
- Total megawatts of solar capacity installed
- Number of parking lots in compliance
- Energy generated annually (MWh)
- Reduced grid peak demand attributable to canopy installations

### Reporting
Require annual reporting by property owners subject to the mandate, with public disclosure of compliance status and installed capacity.
