## Overview

We are currently facing an e-waste crisis where it is cheaper to buy a new device than to fix an old one. This "linear" economy drains local wealth and fills landfills with toxic heavy metals.

This policy flips the economic incentives. It forces manufacturers to disclose how fixable their products are, subsidizes the cost of repair for citizens, and ensures that when a device is truly dead, it is as easy to recycle as a cardboard box.

## Policy 1: The "Repair Score" & Repair Fund (The French Model)

**Concept:**
Consumers cannot currently judge if a $500 laptop will last 2 years or 10. By forcing transparency, we drive market competition for durability.

**The Policy:**
1.  **Mandatory Repairability Index:** All electronics sold within the jurisdiction (Smartphones, Laptops, TVs, Washers) must display a **Score from 0-10** next to the price tag.
    * *Criteria:* Availability of technical manuals, ease of disassembly (screws vs. glue), and price of spare parts.
2.  **The "Repair Fund" (EPR):** Manufacturers must pay an "Eco-Contribution" fee on every new device sold. This money goes into a **Consumer Repair Fund**.
    * *The Benefit:* When a resident goes to a certified local repair shop, the Fund pays for a portion of the bill (e.g., $30 off a phone screen repair), making repair cheaper than replacement.

**Real-World Example:**
* **France (AGEC Law):** Since 2021, France has mandated this 1-10 score. Results show **90% of consumers** find it useful, and companies like Samsung actually redesigned their TVs to get a higher score (e.g., replacing glue with clips) to stay competitive.

## Policy 2: "Curbside Electronics" & Retailer Take-Back

**Concept:**
If recycling a TV requires borrowing a truck and driving to a dump on a Saturday, people will illegally dump it. Recovery must be as easy as trash pickup.

**The Policy:**
1.  **The 1-for-1 Take-Back Rule:** Any retailer selling electronics (including online delivery) *must* offer free removal of the old device upon delivery of the new one.
2.  **On-Demand Curbside Pickup:** The municipality offers an appointment-based pickup service for large e-waste (CRTs, printers) so residents don't need a car to dispose of them.
3.  **Landfill Ban:** It is strictly illegal to place electronics in the regular trash bin (enforced via spot checks).

**Real-World Example:**
* **New York State:** The "Electronic Equipment Recycling and Reuse Act" mandates free, convenient collection. While it faced funding hurdles initially, it successfully diverted hundreds of millions of pounds of toxic lead and mercury from landfills.
* **Aurora, Colorado:** Uses a specialized "Techno Rescue" partner to run specific e-cycling events, ensuring data destruction and preventing hazardous waste leakage.

## Policy 3: Public Leadership (Circular Procurement)

**Concept:**
Local governments are often the largest tech buyers in a region. They can single-handedly create a market for refurbished goods.

**The Policy:**
1.  **"Refurbished First" Rule:** For non-critical IT categories (e.g., monitors, office peripherals, standard laptops), procurement officers must review refurbished options before buying new.
2.  **Minimum Repair Score:** The City will not purchase any IT equipment with a Repairability Index lower than **7/10**.
3.  **Social Enterprise Partnership:** E-waste processing contracts are awarded to non-profits that train and employ people with barriers to employment (e.g., disabilities).

**Real-World Example:**
* **Denver Water:** Partnered with **Blue Star Recyclers**, a non-profit that employs people with autism to disassemble electronics. This creates local jobs while ensuring ethical recycling, rather than shipping waste overseas.
* **City of Toronto:** Implemented a Circular Economy Procurement plan that explicitly weights "repairability" and "end-of-life takeback" in city tenders.

## How to Encourage Adoption (The "Pitch" to Local Govs)

To encourage states and municipalities to adopt this, frame it around **Economic Resilience**, not just "recycling."

1.  **Job Creation (The "Local Repair" Argument):**
    * Manufacturing happens overseas; **Repair happens locally.** A "Repair Fund" policy directly subsidizes local small businesses (repair cafes, independent technicians) rather than foreign factories.
    * *Stat:* Remanufacturing and repair create 200x more jobs per ton of waste than landfilling.

2.  **Supply Chain Independence:**
    * By keeping rare earth metals (gold, cobalt, lithium) circulating locally, the region becomes less vulnerable to global supply chain shocks.

3.  **Fiscal Prudence:**
    * "Circular Procurement" saves tax dollars. Extending the lifespan of municipal laptops from 3 years to 5 years reduces the IT capital budget by **40%**.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: The "Lead by Example" (Months 1-12)
- [ ] **Procurement Audit:** City passes a bylaw requiring all new municipal IT purchases to have a Repair Score >7/10 (using the French data as a proxy until a local index exists).
- [ ] **Contract Reform:** Renegotiate the waste hauling contract to include "On-Demand E-Waste Pickup" (appointment-based).

### Phase 2: The Infrastructure (Year 2)
- [ ] **Retailer Ordinance:** Pass the "1-for-1 Take-Back" law, requiring Best Buy/Amazon to haul away old appliances when delivering new ones.
- [ ] **Repair Directory:** Launch a city-verified "Repair Map" connecting residents to certified repair shops.

### Phase 3: The Market Shift (Year 3+)
- [ ] **The State/Provincial Push:** Lobby the higher level of government to implement the **"Repair Fund"** (EPR fee), as this requires state-level legislative power to tax manufacturers.
