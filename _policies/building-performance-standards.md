## Overview

Building energy policies generally fall into two main categories: **Benchmarking & Transparency Laws** (reporting data to leverage market forces) and **Building Performance Standards (BPS)** (requiring actual improvements to avoid fines). While New York City’s Local Law 97 is a famous example of a Performance Standard, many jurisdictions globally have successfully implemented variations of these policies to decarbonize the built environment.

## Policy Levels: The Framework

Policies can be categorized by their mechanism and stringency:

| Level | Mechanism | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1: Disclosure** | "Report your usage publicly." | Requires owners to report energy data. Relies on market shaming and tenant demand to drive efficiency. | Chicago, Philadelphia, California, UK, Australia. |
| **Level 2: Audits** | "Report usage + get an inspection." | Adds a requirement for periodic energy audits (e.g., every 10 years) to identify savings opportunities. | NYC (Local Law 87), San Francisco, Los Angeles. |
| **Level 3: Performance** | "Hit this target or pay a fine." | Sets legal limits on energy use or emissions. Buildings must improve or face significant financial penalties. | NYC (Local Law 97), Tokyo, Washington D.C., Boston, St. Louis. |

## Global Case Studies: Performance Standards (Mandatory Cuts)

These jurisdictions have moved beyond data collection and legally require buildings to hit specific efficiency targets.

### Tokyo, Japan: The Pioneer
*   **Policy:** Tokyo Cap-and-Trade Program (Launched 2010).
*   **Details:** The world’s first urban cap-and-trade scheme targeting buildings. Large commercial/industrial buildings must reduce CO2 emissions by a set percentage (e.g., 27%) vs. their base year.
*   **Result:** Over 90% of facilities met targets by the second phase, largely through operational improvements rather than buying credits.

### Washington, D.C., USA
*   **Policy:** Building Energy Performance Standards (BEPS).
*   **Details:** Buildings falling below the median Energy Star score for their property type enter a "compliance cycle." They must reduce energy use by 20% or implement a specific list of energy-saving measures.

### Boston, Massachusetts, USA
*   **Policy:** BERDO 2.0 (Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance).
*   **Details:** Updated in 2021 to set declining emissions caps. By 2050, all large buildings must be net-zero.

### Denver, Colorado, USA
*   **Policy:** Energize Denver Ordinance.
*   **Details:** Sets targets based on **Energy Use Intensity (EUI)** rather than just carbon, requiring buildings to reach a specific energy performance level by 2030.

## Global Case Studies: Disclosure & Labeling (Market Shaming)

These jurisdictions rely on transparency to "grade" buildings, allowing the market (tenants and buyers) to punish inefficient properties.

### European Union (27 Countries)
*   **Policy:** Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs).
*   **Details:** Whenever a building is sold or rented, it must have an EPC (rated A to G).
*   **Update:** The "Renovation Wave" strategy requires member states to renovate their worst-performing (G-rated) buildings to at least an F or E class by 2030.

### Australia
*   **Policy:** Commercial Building Disclosure (CBD) Program.
*   **Details:** Requires sellers/lessors of office space to disclose a NABERS Energy rating (1 to 6 stars).
*   **Result:** Often cited as the world's most successful disclosure policy. High-rated buildings command significantly higher rents, driving a voluntary "race to the top."

### California, USA
*   **Policy:** Assembly Bill 802.
*   **Details:** A statewide mandate requiring owners of buildings over 50,000 square feet to report energy use to the California Energy Commission annually.

## Implementation Strategy: The Compromise

To manage pushback from real estate stakeholders while ensuring progress, a **Phased Implementation Timeline** is recommended:

1.  **Years 1-3 (Level 1):** Mandatory Disclosure only. Build the data baseline and allow owners to understand their performance.
2.  **Sunset Clause:** Legislation automatically triggers Level 3 (Performance Standards) after Year 3.
3.  **Year 4+ (Level 3):** Mandatory caps take effect. This gives owners time to prepare and retrofit but guarantees regulatory action.
