## Overview

This policy, the **"Eco-Roof & Energy Resilience Mandate,"** is a "Best-of-Breed" design synthesized from successful precedents in France, California, Tokyo, and Germany. It aims to ensure every building contributes to energy generation or climate resilience by mandating solar or green roofs on new construction and establishing a robust phase-in plan for existing structures.

## Part 1: New Construction Standards

**Goal:** Ensure every new building contributes to energy generation or climate resilience.

This policy applies to all **New Residential** and **New Commercial** developments. Developers must select one of the following compliance paths to receive a building permit.

### A. The Commercial & Multi-Family Standard (France/Toronto Model)
*Based on France’s "Climate and Resilience Act" and Toronto’s "Green Roof Bylaw".*

**Applicability:** Buildings with a footprint larger than **250 m² (2,700 sq. ft)**.

**Requirement:** The roof must be covered (**minimum 60% coverage**) by either:
1.  **Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems:** To generate on-site electricity.
2.  **Insulated Green Roofs:** A vegetative layer installed over high-performance insulation (Minimum R-Value 30+).
    *   *Why Insulated?* Green roofs alone reduce heat, but adding a thick insulation layer (XPS or EPS) underneath ensures the building retains heat in winter and stays cool in summer, maximizing energy efficiency.
3.  **"BioSolar" (The Gold Standard):** A combination of solar panels raised above a green roof.
    *   *Benefit:* Vegetation cools the solar panels, increasing efficiency by up to 5%, while panels shade plants, reducing drought stress.

### B. The Residential Standard (California/Tokyo Model)
*Based on California’s "Title 24" and Tokyo’s 2025 Solar Mandate.*

**Applicability:** Single-family homes and small residential buildings.

**Requirement:** All new homes must include a **Solar PV System** sized to offset **100%** of the home's projected annual electricity usage.

**The Green Alternative:** If a homeowner prefers a green roof (or if the roof is heavily shaded), they may opt for an **Insulated Green Roof**.

**Exemptions:** Only granted for steep-sloped roofs facing north (in Northern Hemisphere) or areas with documented heavy tree shading. These buildings must pay into a **"Community Solar Fund"** instead.

## Part 2: The Retrofit Phase-In Plan (Existing Buildings)

**Goal:** Transition the entire building stock to solar or green roofs over 15 years.
*Mimics the EU Solar Rooftop Initiative, moving from largest to smallest buildings to allow the supply chain to scale up.*

### The "Trigger" Mechanism
Regardless of the timeline below, any building undergoing a **roof replacement** or **major renovation (>25% of building value)** must immediately comply with the New Construction Standards.

### The 10-Year Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Year 1-3** | **Public & Large Commercial:** All government buildings, schools, and commercial buildings >1,000 m² must retrofit for Solar or Green Roofs. |
| **Phase 2** | **Year 4-7** | **Mid-Size Commercial & Multi-Family:** Commercial buildings >500 m² and apartment complexes >10 units must comply. |
| **Phase 3** | **Year 8-10** | **Residential Catch-Up:** Mandatory Solar Readiness assessments. **"Time of Sale" Requirement:** Any home sold after Year 10 must have a compliant roof or place funds in escrow to install one within 12 months. |

## Part 3: Implementation & Technical Requirements

### 1. The "Insulated Green Roof" Definition
To satisfy the requirement for insulation, the policy legally defines a "Compliant Green Roof" as requiring:
*   **Root Barrier & Waterproofing:** High-durability membrane (e.g., EPDM).
*   **Thermal Layer:** Minimum **150mm (6 inches)** of rigid insulation.
*   **Growth Medium:** Minimum **100mm (4 inches)** of engineered soil (prevents it from just being a thin layer of sedum mats).

### 2. Incentives (The "Carrot")
*   **Fast-Track Permitting:** Projects with "BioSolar" (Both Solar + Green) get permit approval in half the standard time.
*   **Property Tax Abatement:** Freezing property tax assessments at pre-solar value for 10 years (modeled on New York City).
*   **Feed-in Tariffs:** Guaranteeing a premium price for solar energy sold back to the grid to ensure ROI in under 7 years.

### 3. Enforcement (The "Stick")
*   **Occupancy Permits:** No Certificate of Occupancy is issued for new builds without the system commissioned.
*   **Non-Compliance Fine:** Existing buildings that miss their phase-in deadline face a fine equivalent to the estimated cost of installation every year until compliant.
