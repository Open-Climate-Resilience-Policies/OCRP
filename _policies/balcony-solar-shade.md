## Overview

In many North American cities, renters are structurally blocked from climate action. They cannot install solar panels because they don't own the roof, and they cannot install external shutters (the most effective way to stop heat) because of aesthetic rules or HOA restrictions.

This policy adapts the **German "Balkonkraftwerk" (Balcony Power Plant)** law and the **Swiss "External Shading"** standard. It reclassifies these devices as "appliances" rather than "construction projects," bypassing the need for complex permits.

## Policy 1: The "Plug-and-Play" Solar Standard (German Model)

**Concept:**
Traditional solar requires permits, electricians, and inspections. "Balcony Solar" consists of 1-2 lightweight panels that plug directly into a standard wall outlet, generating enough power to cover the "baseload" (fridge, router, standby devices) of an apartment.

**The Policy:**
1.  **Deregulation (<800W):** Solar systems under **800 Watts** are legally reclassified as "Home Appliances" (like a microwave). They are exempt from:
    * Building permits.
    * Professional electrician installation requirements.
    * Utility "Interconnection Agreements" (replaced with a simple "Notification" web form).
2.  **The "Privileged Measure" (Tenant Right):** Landlords and HOAs cannot ban balcony solar. They may only request reasonable aesthetic standards (e.g., "panels must be black").
    * *Safety:* Systems must use micro-inverters that auto-shutoff during grid outages (anti-islanding) and be UL-certified.

**Real-World Example:**
* **Germany:** In 2024, Germany passed a law declaring balcony solar a "privileged measure," meaning landlords can no longer block it without "substantial" cause. Over **700,000 systems** are now installed, mostly by renters, simply plugging them into standard outlets.

## Policy 2: The "Right to Shade" (Geneva Model)

**Concept:**
Air conditioning is reactive (removing heat after it enters). Shutters are proactive (stopping heat before it hits the glass). External shutters are ~70% more effective than internal blinds because they prevent the "Greenhouse Effect" inside the glass.

**The Policy:**
1.  **New Build Mandate:** All new residential buildings must be equipped with **External Movable Shading** (e.g., rolling shutters, venetian blinds, or sliding screens) on East, South, and West-facing windows.
    * *Standard:* Shading must demonstrate a "Solar Heat Gain Coefficient" (SHGC) improvement of at least 0.15.
2.  **Retrofit Right:** Tenants in existing buildings have the "Right to Shade." Landlords cannot unreasonably deny the installation of **non-permanent** external shading (e.g., clamp-on awnings or suction-mounted shutters) that do not drill into the facade.

**Real-World Example:**
* **Geneva, Switzerland:** Building codes effectively mandate external shading to meet energy efficiency targets. This is why most Swiss apartments feature "storen" (external blinds) that can be lowered during the day, drastically reducing the need for AC even in summer heatwaves.
* **United Kingdom:** The new **"Part O" Building Regulation** (2022) legally requires new homes to be designed to limit overheating, explicitly pushing developers toward external shading rather than just adding more AC.

## Policy 3: Grid Safety & "Breaker Masking"

**Concept:**
A technical concern in the US is "Breaker Masking"—where solar power back-feeding into a circuit might allow the wires to carry more current than the breaker is designed for.

**The Policy:**
1.  **The "Dedicated Circuit" Rule:** For new balcony construction, the outdoor outlet must be on a dedicated 15A or 20A circuit.
2.  **Smart Meters:** The local utility must swap the tenant's meter for a bi-directional "Smart Meter" within 30 days of notification, free of charge, to ensure they are credited for any excess power exported to the grid.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Code Update (Months 1-6)
* [ ] **Adopt UL 1741:** Update the municipal electrical code to explicitly permit "Plug-in Grid-Interactive Inverters" that meet the UL 1741 safety standard.
* [ ] **Zoning Text Amendment:** Modify the "permitted encroachments" list to allow solar panels and shutters to hang over balcony railings (which is often currently banned by setbacks).

### Phase 2: The Tenant Rights (Months 6-12)
* [ ] **Pass the Ordinance:** Enact the "Tenant Energy Rights Act," forbidding lease clauses that ban plug-in solar or external shading.
* [ ] **Safety Campaign:** Launch an educational campaign ("Plug in the Sun") teaching residents to check their outlet type (e.g., ensuring they don't overload an old circuit).

### Phase 3: The Market Scale (Year 2+)
* [ ] **Group Purchase Program:** The City partners with a manufacturer to offer a "bulk buy" discount on certified balcony kits (Panel + Micro-inverter + Brackets), bringing the cost under $500 per unit.
