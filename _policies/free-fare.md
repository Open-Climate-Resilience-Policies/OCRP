The "Fare-Free" Paradox Bundle (Transit)
​Inspired by "Should Public Transit Be Free?"
​The Problem: Making transit free sounds progressive, but it often degrades service quality (dirty trains, delays) which drives away the middle class, turning transit into a "service for the poor" rather than a "utility for everyone."
The Insight: Riders care more about Frequency than Price.
