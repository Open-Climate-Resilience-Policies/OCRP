# Clean Heat Standard
**Discussion Title:** [Feedback]: Emergency Replacements & Grid Capacity

We are debating the Clean Heat Standard (Transition off Gas).

## 💼 For HVAC Contractors & Suppliers

**The "January Emergency":** If a gas boiler dies in the middle of winter, can you physically install a Heat Pump in 24 hours? If not, a "Ban on New Gas" might leave families freezing. Do we need an "Emergency Exemption"?

**Supply Chain:** What is the current lead time for heat pumps in this region?

## 🧪 For Utility Experts

**Winter Peaks:** If 100% of this neighborhood switches to electric heat, does the local substation explode? Do we need "Panel Upgrade" subsidies first?

## 🏠 For Homeowners

**The Bill:** Have you switched? Did your monthly operating cost go up or down? We need real data to verify the "Business Case."

## Draft Implementation Notes

- Consider an Emergency Exemption allowing temporary gas replacements until a heat pump can be safely installed.
- Create a bulk procurement program to shrink lead times and costs for heat pumps.
- Subsidize panel/upgrades for neighborhoods where distribution capacity is constrained.
