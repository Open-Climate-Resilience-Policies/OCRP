title: "Organic Waste Diversion & Food Recovery Model"
type: generic-policy
summary: "A practical waste management framework that keeps food and organic materials out of landfills through mandatory separation, unit-based pricing, and food donation protections. This reduces methane emissions, extends landfill life, and strengthens local food security."

## Overview

Food waste is a major and avoidable source of climate pollution. When organic material decomposes in landfills without oxygen, it produces methane, a greenhouse gas with far greater short-term warming impact than carbon dioxide.

The **Organic Waste Diversion & Food Recovery Model** shifts a city from a linear system—collect and bury—to a circular one—separate, recover, and reuse. Edible food is redirected to people first. Remaining scraps are converted into compost or biogas rather than buried.

Cities using this model reduce landfill costs, cut emissions, and turn waste management into a local economic asset instead of a long-term liability.

## Global Case Studies

### 1. South Korea: RFID Pay-As-You-Throw (PAYT)
**The Policy:**
South Korea banned food waste from landfills nationwide and paired the ban with unit-based pricing to change household behavior.

**How it Works (Weight-Based Pricing):**
- Residents use RFID cards to open communal bins.
- Waste is weighed automatically and households are charged based on weight.
- Residents lower costs by reducing moisture and separating scraps correctly.

**Outcome:**
Food waste diversion rates increased from negligible levels in the 1990s to near-universal recovery after national rollout.

### 2. Vermont, USA: Universal Recycling Law (Act 148)
**The Policy:**
Vermont phased in a statewide ban on disposing of organic materials, applying first to large generators and eventually to all households.

**How it Works (Infrastructure First):**
- Collection and processing capacity was required before enforcement.
- Large businesses were regulated first, residents last.
- The law prioritizes donation of edible food before composting.

**Outcome:**
Food recovery programs expanded statewide and landfill-bound organics declined steadily after full implementation.

### 3. France: Anti-Waste Law for a Circular Economy
**The Policy:**
France prohibited large supermarkets from destroying or discarding unsold edible food.

**How it Works (Mandatory Donation):**
- Stores above a size threshold must sign contracts with food aid organizations.
- Non-compliance triggers financial penalties.

**Takeaway:**
Food recovery can be enforced upstream, before waste enters the municipal system.

## Model Policy Language

*The following language is designed for use in municipal ordinances or state enabling legislation.*

### A. Mandatory Source Separation

*Purpose: To prevent contamination and ensure organic materials are recoverable.*

**Section 1.1: Separation Requirement**  
"All generators of solid waste, including residential, commercial, and institutional entities, shall separate Organic Materials from landfill-bound waste."

**Section 1.2: Hauler Obligations**  
"Licensed waste haulers shall provide organic waste collection services to customers and ensure collected materials are delivered to permitted composting or digestion facilities."

### B. Food Donation Liability Protection ("Good Samaritan" Provision)

*Purpose: To remove legal barriers that discourage food donation.*

**Section 2.1: Liability Limitation**  
"A food facility that donates food fit for human consumption at the time of donation to a nonprofit organization shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability arising from the consumption of the donated food, except in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct."

### C. Unit-Based Pricing (Pay-As-You-Throw)

*Purpose: To align household costs with waste generation.*

**Section 3.1: Variable-Rate Pricing**  
"The City shall establish variable-rate pricing for landfill waste collection based on container size or weight."

**Section 3.2: Diversion Incentives**  
"Recycling and organic waste collection services shall be provided at a flat or subsidized rate to encourage diversion from landfill disposal."

## Todo: Implementation Roadmap

Use this checklist to phase in the policy without service disruption.

### Phase 1: Audit & Capacity (Months 1–6)
- [ ] **Waste Characterization Study:** Determine the share of organics in the waste stream.
- [ ] **Processing Capacity Review:** Identify available composting and anaerobic digestion capacity.
- [ ] **Procurement:** Select standardized bins and collection equipment for pilot areas.

### Phase 2: Commercial Phase-In (Months 6–18)
- [ ] **Target Large Generators:** Require diversion by grocery stores, hospitals, and institutions above a defined threshold.
- [ ] **Technical Assistance:** Provide guidance and small grants for on-site separation and storage.

### Phase 3: Universal Mandate (Year 2+)
- [ ] **Residential Rollout:** Expand organic collection citywide.
- [ ] **Education-First Enforcement:** Use contamination tags and warnings before fines.
- [ ] **Closed-Loop Use:** Return finished compost to local parks, farms, and residents.

## Co-Benefits

* **Climate Protection:** Methane emissions are reduced at the source.
* **Food Security:** More edible food reaches local pantries and shelters.
* **Soil Health:** Compost improves soil structure and reduces fertilizer dependence.
* **Local Jobs:** Composting and food recovery support more local employment than landfilling.
