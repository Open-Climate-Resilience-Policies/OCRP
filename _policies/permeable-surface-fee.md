# Permeable Surface Fee

We are evaluating a fee/incentive program to encourage permeable surfaces and reduce stormwater runoff.

Key questions:
- What is a fair fee structure that incentivizes permeable paving while not unduly burdening small property owners?
- Can credits be provided for community-level projects (e.g., shared rain gardens) to encourage collaboration?
- How to measure and verify permeability over time?

Draft mechanisms:
- Tiered fee based on impervious area percentage.
- Grants/credits for retrofits in low-income neighborhoods.
- Annual verification via inspection or certified contractor reports.
