## Overview

This model policy outlines best practices for urban lawn watering, designed to manage peak demand on water treatment infrastructure and ensure water reserves for emergencies. The framework combines mandatory enforceable restrictions with educational cultural practices to reduce overall water demand while maintaining functional green spaces.

## Mandatory Policy Restrictions

Municipalities implement these bylaws to manage peak demand on water treatment plants and ensure reserves for emergencies such as firefighting.

### Odd/Even Scheduling

**The Policy:**
Residential properties with odd-numbered addresses are permitted to water on odd-numbered calendar days, while even-numbered addresses water on even days.

**Best Practice Variation:**
In high-drought areas or during times of crisis, this schedule should be reduced to:
- One day per week (e.g., aligned with garbage collection days)
- Specific fixed days (e.g., Odd addresses on Monday/Thursday, Even addresses on Tuesday/Friday) to further space out demand on the system.

### Time-of-Day Restrictions

**The Policy:**
Watering is permitted only during specific windows, typically early morning (e.g., 5:00 AM – 9:00 AM) or late evening (e.g., 7:00 PM – 10:00 PM).

**Best Practice:**
Limit watering to **early mornings only** (e.g., 4:00 AM – 9:00 AM).
- **Rationale:** Minimizes evaporation compared to mid-day watering (where up to 50% of water is lost).
- **Avoid Evening Watering:** Discourage or prohibit evening watering as allowing grass to sit wet overnight promotes fungal diseases.

### Prohibition of "Hard Surface" Watering

**The Policy:**
It is a violation to allow sprinklers to overspray onto impermeable surfaces such as sidewalks, driveways, or roads.

**Best Practice:**
This provision allows bylaw officers to ticket evident wastage immediately without needing to measure water volume, simplifying enforcement.

### Emergency Tier Systems

**The Policy:**
Bylaws should contain defined "Levels" of restriction that can be triggered by the municipality based on reservoir levels or drought conditions.

**Best Practice Structure:**
- **Level 1:** Standard restrictions (Odd/Even, Time-of-Day).
- **Level 2:** Reduced days (e.g., 1 day/week) or tighter hours.
- **Level 3:** Total ban on all outdoor lawn watering.
  - *Note:* Level 3 should typically still allow hand-watering of food gardens (vegetables/fruit) to support local food security.

## Exceptions and Permits

To ensure strict policies are practical and livable, successful frameworks include specific exemptions.

### New Sod/Seed Permits

**Provision:**
Residents can apply for a temporary permit (typically 21–30 days) to water daily to establish new grass.
- **Requirement:** Proof of purchase for sod or seed.
- **Timeframe:** Watering usually restricted to specific hours even with a permit.

### Nematode Application

**Provision:**
Brief exceptions (e.g., 1-2 days) are granted for applying biological pest controls, such as nematodes for grubs, which require watering to soak into the soil to be effective.

## Recommended Best Practices (Educational)

Mandatory policies are most effective when paired with education on how to maintain a lawn with less water.

### The "One Inch" Rule

**Guidance:**
Educate residents that established lawns only need **2.5 cm (1 inch)** of water per week, including rainfall.
- **Tool:** Encourage the use of a rain gauge (or a tuna can) to help residents visualize this limit and avoid over-watering.

### Mowing Height Policy

**Guidance:**
Encourage a mowing height of **3 inches (7.5 cm)**.
- **Benefit:** Taller grass shades the soil, reduces evaporation, and develops deeper roots that are more drought-resistant compared to short-cut grass.

### Dormancy Acceptance ("Brown is Gold")

**Guidance:**
Launch municipal campaigns emphasizing that "Brown is Gold" or "Brown is Dormant, Not Dead."
- **Fact:** Healthy lawns can go dormant for up to 6 weeks in summer and bounce back when rain returns.

### Smart Irrigation

**Guidance:**
Provide incentives or rebates for installing water-saving technologies:
- **Rain Sensors:** Automatically shut off systems during rainfall.
- **Smart Controllers:** Adjust watering schedules based on local weather data.

## Enforcement Best Practices

### Progressive Enforcement

**Strategy:**
1. **First Offense:** Warning or educational notice.
2. **Subsequent Offenses:** Escalating fines for repeat violations.

### Patrols

**Strategy:**
Utilize summer students or bylaw officers to patrol during prohibited hours (specifically mid-day) to identify and tag non-compliant properties.

## Co-Benefits

- **Water Conservation:** Significantly reduces potable water consumption during peak summer months.
- **Energy Savings:** Reduces energy required for water treatment and pumping.
- **Infrastructure Resilience:** Extends the lifespan of water treatment facilities by reducing peak load stress.
- **Ecosystem Health:** Reduces runoff carrying fertilizers and pesticides into storm sewers and waterways.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Public Communication:** Clear, multi-channel communication (social media, utility bill inserts, signs) is crucial when restriction levels change.
- **Officer Training:** Ensure enforcement officers are trained to educate residents first before issuing fines.
- **Data Monitoring:** Track reservoir levels and consumption rates daily to trigger restriction levels appropriately.
