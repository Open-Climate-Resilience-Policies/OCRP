## Overview

This model policy provides a comprehensive framework for urban forest management based on best practices from the Cities4Forests initiative's "Urban Forests for Healthier Cities: Policy, Planning, Regulations, and Institutional Arrangements" guide. Urban forests are recognized as essential infrastructure that provides critical services including heat reduction, flood control, air purification, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity support.

The framework is built on four pillars: Policy Principles, Planning, Regulations, and Institutional Arrangements, designed to help cities effectively manage and expand their urban forest canopy while prioritizing equity and resilience.

## Policy Principles

### 1. Conserve First, Restore Second

**Rationale:** Protecting existing mature forests is more effective and less costly than planting new ones. Old trees provide significantly more ecosystem services (carbon storage, cooling, biodiversity habitat) than young saplings and can take decades to replace functionally.

**Implementation:**
- Prioritize preservation of existing mature trees in all development and planning decisions
- Create protected status for heritage trees and mature forest stands
- Limit urban expansion into surrounding forest zones
- Account for the "forest footprint" of city procurement decisions (timber, food, materials)

**Examples in Practice:**
- **Oslo, Norway**: Protects the "Marka" forest ring from development sprawl and tracks deforestation impact of goods purchased by the city ([Oslo Climate Strategy 2030](https://www.oslo.kommune.no/politics-and-administration/green-oslo/best-practices/climate-strategy/#gref))
- **Mexico City, Mexico**: Focuses on preventing illegal logging and sprawl in the "Suelo de Conservación" (conservation land) that serves as the city's primary water source ([Green Infrastructure Strategy](https://www.c40.org/case-studies/mexico-city-creating-a-green-infrastructure-system/))

### 2. Treat Forests as Essential Infrastructure

**Rationale:** Urban forests should be managed with the same level of investment, maintenance, and legal protection as roads, water systems, and utilities, given their critical role in providing ecosystem services.

**Implementation:**
- Integrate urban forest management plans into official climate action and adaptation strategies
- Allocate dedicated municipal budgets for tree maintenance and expansion
- Establish departments or positions specifically responsible for urban forest management
- Use infrastructure planning methodologies (asset management, lifecycle costing) for tree management

**Examples in Practice:**
- **Sacramento, California, USA**: Trees are legally recognized as a form of utility and infrastructure for cooling and air quality, integrated into the city's Climate Action & Adaptation Plan ([Sacramento Urban Forest Plan](https://www.cityofsacramento.gov/ParksandRec/Parks/Urban-Forestry/masterplan))
- **Jakarta, Indonesia**: Utilized infrastructure mapping approaches to target tree planting in flood-prone areas where trees act as natural water management systems ([Cities4Forests Jakarta Project](https://cities4forests.com/jakarta/))

### 3. Prioritize Equity

**Rationale:** Tree cover and green spaces are often inequitably distributed, with low-income and marginalized neighborhoods suffering from heat islands and lack of canopy. Environmental justice demands equitable access to nature's benefits.

**Implementation:**
- Map existing tree canopy distribution and identify underserved neighborhoods
- Set specific targets for increasing canopy cover in priority communities
- Ensure community engagement in tree species selection and placement
- Target public investment in areas with the greatest need and least existing coverage

**Examples in Practice:**
- **Vancouver, Canada**: Set a goal to double street tree density in specific low-income neighborhoods like the Downtown Eastside to address inequity ([Urban Forest Strategy](https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/urban-forest-strategy.pdf))
- **Glasgow, Scotland**: Adopted a "10 trees for every person" target with explicit focus on urban areas to ensure residents in "grey" areas have access to green space ([Clyde Climate Forest](https://clyderebuild.co.uk/our-work/clyde-climate-forest))

### 4. Use the "Right Tree, Right Place"

**Rationale:** Tree survival and benefit maximization depend on matching species to site conditions, considering both current environment and future climate projections.

**Implementation:**
- Develop species selection guides based on local soil, water, space, and climate conditions
- Consider future climate scenarios when selecting species (heat tolerance, drought resistance)
- Avoid conflicts with built infrastructure (power lines, sidewalks, buildings)
- Plan for mature tree size to ensure adequate growing space

### 5. Promote Biodiversity

**Rationale:** Monocultures are vulnerable to pests, diseases, and climate change. Diverse forests with native species are more resilient and provide better habitat for wildlife.

**Implementation:**
- Establish minimum species diversity targets (e.g., no single species exceeds 10% of total canopy)
- Prioritize native species that support local ecosystems
- Plant a mix of age classes to ensure continuous canopy cover
- Create habitat connectivity corridors for urban wildlife

## Planning Best Practices

### Inventory and Assess

**Action:** Conduct comprehensive inventories to understand the location, species, health, size, and condition of existing urban forest assets.

**Methods:**
- Ground-based tree surveys with GPS tagging
- Remote sensing using satellite imagery or LiDAR
- i-Tree or similar urban forest assessment tools
- Regular updates (every 3-5 years)

**Metrics to Track:**
- Total canopy cover (%)
- Number of trees by species, size class, and condition
- Canopy distribution by neighborhood
- Economic value of ecosystem services provided

### Set Clear Targets

**Action:** Establish measurable, time-bound goals for urban forest expansion and maintenance.

**Example Targets:**
- Canopy cover: "30% canopy by 2030" or "40% citywide canopy by 2050"
- Access: "Every resident within 300 meters of a green space"
- Equity: "Minimum 20% canopy in all neighborhoods"
- No net loss: "Replace every tree removed with 2-3 new trees"

### Develop a Strategic Management Plan

**Action:** Create a comprehensive urban forest master plan that outlines strategies, responsibilities, timelines, and budgets.

**Plan Components:**
- Vision statement and guiding principles
- Current conditions assessment
- Canopy goals and targets
- Planting priorities and species lists
- Maintenance schedules and standards
- Risk management (storm damage, disease, pests)
- Budget projections and funding strategies
- Implementation timeline with milestones

### Monitor and Evaluate

**Action:** Track progress against goals using data and adjust strategies based on results.

**Evaluation Methods:**
- Annual reporting on canopy change and tree planting
- Periodic re-inventory to measure progress
- Performance indicators (survival rates, growth rates, maintenance costs)
- Community surveys on satisfaction and access

## Regulatory Best Practices

### Tree Protection Ordinances

**Purpose:** Establish legal protections for existing trees to prevent unnecessary removal.

**Key Provisions:**
- Protected tree definitions (e.g., trees over 50cm diameter, heritage trees, trees in sensitive areas)
- Prohibition on removal without permit on both public and private land
- Criteria for permit approval (health, safety, unavoidable conflict)
- Penalties for unauthorized removal

**Examples in Practice:**
- **Toronto, Canada**: Private tree protection bylaws require permits to remove trees of certain diameter, with significant fines for violations ([Strategic Forest Management Plan](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/accountability-operations-customer-service/long-term-vision-plans-and-strategies/strategic-forest-management-plan/))

### Development Standards

**Purpose:** Ensure new construction protects existing trees and provides space for new planting.

**Key Provisions:**
- Tree protection zones during construction (root protection areas)
- Minimum setbacks from protected trees
- Tree canopy requirements for new developments (% of lot area)
- Permeability standards to ensure adequate soil volume
- Street tree planting requirements for new streets

### Replacement Mandates

**Purpose:** Achieve "no net loss" of canopy by requiring compensation for removed trees.

**Key Provisions:**
- Replacement ratios (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1 based on size of removed tree)
- Payment-in-lieu option if on-site planting is not feasible
- Minimum tree size and species requirements for replacements
- Monitoring and enforcement of replacement obligations

**Examples in Practice:**
- **Toronto, Canada**: Developers and homeowners must pay for replacement trees when removal permits are granted, enforcing "no net loss" principle

## Institutional Arrangements

### Cross-Departmental Collaboration

**Purpose:** Break down organizational silos to integrate urban forestry across all relevant city departments.

**Implementation:**
- Establish inter-departmental working groups or steering committees
- Integrate tree considerations into transportation, water, planning, and health department projects
- Shared data systems and mapping platforms
- Joint planning for capital projects (e.g., adding trees to street redesigns)

**Key Departments to Coordinate:**
- Parks and Recreation (tree maintenance)
- Public Works (street trees, utilities)
- Planning and Development (zoning, development review)
- Water/Stormwater (green infrastructure)
- Climate/Sustainability (mitigation and adaptation)
- Public Health (heat response, air quality)

### Community Engagement

**Purpose:** Involve residents in planning and stewardship to ensure projects meet local needs and build a culture of tree care.

**Engagement Strategies:**
- Public consultation during plan development
- Community tree planting events
- Adopt-a-tree or tree steward programs
- Educational programs in schools and community centers
- Grievance mechanisms for tree removal decisions
- Community representation on urban forestry advisory boards

**Benefits:**
- Increased tree survival through community watering and care
- Projects aligned with neighborhood preferences
- Enhanced social cohesion and environmental awareness
- Reduced vandalism and improved tree protection

### Collaboration Across Jurisdictions

**Purpose:** Manage connected ecosystems that cross municipal boundaries, such as watersheds and wildlife corridors.

**Implementation:**
- Regional urban forest strategies or compacts
- Shared funding mechanisms (e.g., regional tree planting funds)
- Coordinated species selection and habitat corridor planning
- Joint monitoring and data sharing
- Alignment of regulations across jurisdictions

## Co-Benefits
