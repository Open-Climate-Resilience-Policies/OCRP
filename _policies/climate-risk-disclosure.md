# The "Truth in Sale" Real Estate Policy
**Discussion Title:** [Feedback]: Property Values, Insurance, and the "Right to Know"

We are reviewing the Climate Risk Disclosure mandate for Real Estate.

## 💼 For Real Estate Agents & Developers

**The "Crash" Fear:** If we put a "High Flood Risk" sticker on every listing in the flood plain, does it crash the local market overnight? Or is it better to have a "soft landing" now than a foreclosure crisis later?

**Liability:** If you sell a home without disclosing the 2050 flood risk, can the buyer sue you in 10 years? This policy protects you by making disclosure mandatory.

## 🧪 For Insurers / Actuaries

**Accuracy:** Are the FEMA maps accurate enough to be legal binding? Or should we use private risk models (like First Street Foundation)?

## 🏠 For Home Buyers

**The "Lemon" Law:** Would you buy a house if you knew it would be uninsurable in 7 years? Do you feel you have access to this data right now?

## Draft Implementation Notes

- Require a mandatory climate risk disclosure at point of sale covering 10/25/50 year horizons.
- Specify acceptable risk models and a process for appeals if a buyer or seller disputes the risk assessment.
- Consider transitional measures (e.g., disclosure without immediate insurance penalties) to avoid abrupt market destabilization.
