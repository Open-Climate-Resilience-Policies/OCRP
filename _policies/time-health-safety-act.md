# Time Health & Safety Act

## Summary
Abolish the biannual clock change (Daylight Saving Time, DST) and adopt Permanent Standard Time to reduce accidents, improve public health, and lower carbon emissions. Evidence shows that DST increases energy use, emissions, and accident rates, while Permanent Standard Time aligns with both climate and circadian science.

## 1. The Climate Argument
- **AC Penalty:** DST increases evening air conditioning use, raising residential energy demand and emissions. Studies (e.g., Indiana) show a 1% increase in electricity use due to DST.
- **Rebound Effect:** Extended daylight encourages more evening driving, increasing gasoline consumption and pollution.
- **Ozone Penalty:** DST shifts rush hour to hotter, sunnier periods, accelerating smog formation in urban areas.

## 2. The Health & Safety Argument
- **Accident Spike:** The "Spring Forward" transition causes a 6% spike in fatal car crashes and a 5.7% increase in workplace injuries due to sleep deprivation.
- **Chronic Effects:** DST misaligns social and biological clocks, causing chronic sleep loss, reduced productivity, and increased health risks.
- **Permanent Standard Time:** Aligns clocks with the sun, reducing "social jetlag" and supporting better sleep, health, and safety outcomes.

## 3. Global Precedents
- **Mexico (2022):** Abolished DST, citing negligible energy savings and significant health/accident costs.
- **Yukon, Canada (2020):** Adopted Permanent DST for local context, prioritizing elimination of the disruptive switch.
- **Arizona & Hawaii:** Never adopted DST; serve as control groups showing no accident spike after "Spring Forward."

## 4. Policy Mandate
1. **Abolish the Switch:** End biannual clock changes. Adopt a single, year-round time standard.
2. **Adopt Permanent Standard Time:** Default to the natural sun clock, as recommended by sleep and climate scientists.
3. **Public Health Campaign:** Educate on the health, safety, and climate benefits of Standard Time.

## 5. Evidence & Citations
- University of Colorado Boulder: 6% spike in fatal car accidents after DST spring forward.
- Mexico: Health and accident data drove DST abolition in 2022.
- American Academy of Sleep Medicine: Endorses Permanent Standard Time for health and safety.

## Improvements
- Add more local case studies (e.g., EU, Russia, Australia).
- Quantify emissions impact in different climate zones.
- Include cost-benefit analysis for business and schools.
