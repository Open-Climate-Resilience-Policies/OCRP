## Overview

This model policy establishes standards for "Living Roofs" and "Sponge City" infrastructure. It aims to utilize underused roof space for stormwater management, thermal regulation, and energy generation, while simultaneously reducing surface runoff and recharging groundwater through permeable surfaces.

## Policy Framework A: The "Living Roof" & Solar Standard

**Purpose:** To utilize underused roof space for stormwater management, thermal regulation, and energy generation.

### 1. Applicability

This policy applies to:

*   **New Construction:** All new residential, commercial, and industrial buildings with a total gross floor area exceeding 2,000 square meters.
*   **Major Renovations:** Existing buildings undergoing roof replacement or structural renovations valued at over 50% of the building's assessed value.
*   **Municipal Buildings:** All new government-owned facilities, regardless of size.

### 2. The Mandate

Developers must utilize at least **60% of the Available Roof Area** for one (or a combination) of the following:

*   **Option A: Extensive Green Roof:** A vegetation layer consisting of drought-resistant sedums, grasses, or native wildflowers with a minimum soil depth of 10cm.
*   **Option B: Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Array:** Solar panels capable of generating a minimum specified kilowatt-peak (kWp) based on building energy modeling.
*   **Option C: Bio-Solar Roof (Recommended):** A hybrid approach installing solar panels over a green roof. This increases panel efficiency (by cooling the panels) while maintaining stormwater retention.

### 3. Compliance & Exceptions

*   **Stormwater Retention:** The installed system must be capable of retaining the first 25mm (1 inch) of rainfall during a storm event.
*   **Exemptions:** Buildings may be exempt if they prove structural incompatibility (for retrofits) or if the roof is used for essential mechanical equipment or public amenities (roof gardens/terraces count toward the Green requirement).

## Policy Framework B: The Permeable Surface & "Sponge" Ordinance

**Purpose:** To reduce surface runoff, recharge groundwater, and alleviate pressure on the municipal sewer system.

### 1. Public Infrastructure Standards

*   **Sidewalks & Plazas:** All new public sidewalks and pedestrian plazas must utilize permeable pavers or porous concrete that allows water filtration rates of at least 2,000 mm/hour.
*   **Bioswales:** Road reconstruction projects must include curbside bioswales (vegetated ditches) every 50 meters to collect and filter road runoff before it enters the storm drain.

### 2. Private Development Requirements

*   **Parking Lots:** Any new surface parking lot with more than 10 spaces must utilize permeable paving for at least 70% of the parking stall area.
*   **Driveways:** New residential driveways are prohibited from being constructed of 100% impermeable asphalt or poured concrete. Acceptable alternatives include permeable pavers, ribbon driveways, or gravel grids.

### 3. The "Zero Runoff" Goal

Large developments (over 1 hectare) must demonstrate a "Pre-Development Hydrology" plan. The site must manage stormwater on-site (via retention ponds, rain gardens, or underground cisterns) such that the rate of water leaving the property is no greater than it was before the building was constructed.

## Summary of Benefits

| Benefit Category | Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Economic** | Extends roof lifespan by 2–3x (protects waterproofing from UV); lowers HVAC costs. |
| **Environmental** | Reduces the "Urban Heat Island" effect (cooling the city by 1–2°C); captures carbon. |
| **Infrastructure** | Prevents "Combined Sewer Overflows" (CSO) by delaying storm runoff. |

## Real-World Policy Calibration

*   **The "Copenhagen Model":** Use this if you want a broad mandate. Copenhagen requires green roofs on all new roofs with a slope of less than 30 degrees.
*   **The "Toronto Bylaw":** Use this for larger cities. Toronto focuses specifically on buildings greater than 2,000 square meters to maximize impact on big developers while sparing small homeowners.
