## Overview



The **"15-Minute City"** (also called a "Complete Neighborhood") is a global standard for better city planning. The goal is simple: everyone should be able to reach their daily needs—groceries, pharmacies, schools, and parks—within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from their home.

Instead of separating housing far away from businesses (which forces people to drive), this model brings them closer together. This reduces car dependency, lowers pollution, and helps local businesses thrive.

While Paris made this name famous, cities all over the world are using it. This document provides real-world examples, simple laws you can copy, and a checklist to get started.

## Global Case Studies

### 1. Melbourne, Australia: The "20-Minute Neighbourhood"
**The Policy:**
Melbourne built this idea into their official long-term plan, *[Plan Melbourne 2017–2050](https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/guides-and-resources/strategies-and-initiatives/plan-melbourne)*. They chose "20 minutes" because their suburbs are more spread out, which is a realistic goal for many North American cities too.

**How it Works (The "Hallmarks" Test):**
A neighborhood isn't just "zoned" for shops; it has to pass a test to count as a 20-minute neighborhood. It must be:
* **Walkable:** Safe sidewalks and bike paths.
* **Green:** Access to parks and public plazas.
* **Active:** It must have local jobs and shops, not just houses.

### 2. Portland, Oregon, USA: The "Complete Neighborhoods" Overlay
**The Policy:**
Portland’s *[Climate Action Plan](https://www.portland.gov/bps/climate-action/history-and-reports)* set a goal: 90% of residents should live in "complete neighborhoods."

**How it Works (The "Urban Center" Focus):**
Portland didn't change the whole city at once. They picked specific "Centers" and main streets to build up.
* **Focus on Affordability:** They use [Inclusionary Zoning](https://www.portland.gov/phb/inclusionary-housing), which means if developers want to build big apartments, they *must* include affordable units. This ensures the 15-minute lifestyle isn't just for the wealthy.

### 3. Barcelona, Spain: "Superblocks" (Superilles)
**The Policy:**
This is about changing *streets*, not just buildings.



**How it Works (Street Reallocation):**
The city takes a grid of nine blocks (3x3) and closes the inside streets to through-traffic. Cars must drive around the outside.
* **Inside the blocks:** Streets are turned into playgrounds, picnic areas, and markets.
* **Safety:** The speed limit inside is dropped to 10km/h (6mph).

**Takeaway:** You don't always need new buildings. You can create a "15-minute city" feel just by changing how streets are used. (Read more on the [Superblocks Model](https://www.barcelona.cat/pla-superilla-barcelona/en)).

## Model Policy Language

*The following language is adapted from the [SmartCode](https://smartcodecentral.com/) framework. It is ready to be pasted into a city's Comprehensive Plan.*

### A. General Plan (Vision Statement)

**Goal: The 15-Minute Neighborhood Framework**
"The City aims to create 'Complete Neighborhoods' where residents can access daily needs—including grocery, pharmacy, elementary education, and public recreation—within a 15-minute walk or bike ride."

**Policy 1.1:**
"The City will prioritize 'Mixed-Use' (blending homes and shops) over 'Single-Use' (homes only) in all future land use decisions."

**Policy 1.2:**
"The City will focus spending on sidewalks and bike lanes within a 1-mile radius of identified Neighborhood Centers."

### B. Zoning Ordinance (Specific Code)

#### 1. The "Corner Store" Rule (Neighborhood Commercial Overlay)
*Purpose: To let small businesses open in residential areas so people can walk to get coffee or milk.*

**Permitted Uses:**
The following small businesses are allowed in Residential Zones provided they are under 1,500 square feet:
* Coffee shops, bakeries, and delis (no drive-throughs).
* Small grocery or specialty food stores.
* Personal services (barbershops, tailors, dry cleaners).
* Small offices or co-working spaces.

**Rules to protect neighbors:**
* **Signage:** Must be small and non-lit.
* **Hours:** Limited to 7:00 AM – 9:00 PM to keep noise down.

#### 2. Parking Reform
*Purpose: Giant parking lots push buildings apart, making walking impossible. This rule fixes that.*

**Exemptions:**
You do *not* need to build off-street parking for:
* Shops under 2,500 square feet if they are near a bus/train stop.
* Small residential projects (4 units or fewer).

**Shared Parking:**
New buildings can build 40% less parking if they share a lot with a neighbor (e.g., an office shares spaces with a restaurant that is only open at night).

#### 3. "Live-Work" Units
*Purpose: To help people work from home effectively.*

**Definition:**
"A building that combines a living space with a work space, used by the person living there."

**The Rule:**
Professional services (like accountants) and small makers (like potters or artists) are allowed by right, as long as they don't create dangerous noise or fumes.

## Todo: Implementation Roadmap

If you are a city councilor or planner, use this checklist to launch this policy.

### Phase 1: Research & Audit (Months 1-3)
- [ ] **Run an "Amenity Audit":** Use GIS mapping to locate all grocery stores, parks, and schools.
- [ ] **Identify the Gaps:** Highlight the "food deserts" and "green deserts" (areas more than a 15-minute walk from these goods).
- [ ] **Calculate the Savings:** Work with the finance department to calculate the tax revenue per acre of mixed-use vs. single-use zones (see [Urban3](https://www.urbanthree.com/) for examples).

### Phase 2: Pilot Program (Months 3-6)
- [ ] **Select a "Flex Zone":** Pick one intersection in a residential neighborhood that lacks amenities.
- [ ] **Pass a Pilot Ordinance:** Temporarily rezone that intersection to allow a corner cafe, a co-working space, or a pop-up market.
- [ ] **Measure Success:** After 6 months, survey the neighbors: Did they walk more? Did they like it?

### Phase 3: Legislative Action (Months 6-12)
- [ ] **Adopt Missing Middle Housing:** Legalize duplexes, triplexes, and [ADUs](https://www.planning.org/knowledgebase/accessorydwellings/) (backyard cottages) in single-family zones.
    * *Why? Local shops need nearby customers to survive.*
    * 
- [ ] **Update Parking Minimums:** Remove requirements for parking spaces for small businesses to lower construction costs.
- [ ] **Formal Vote:** Present the "15-Minute City" General Plan amendment to the City Council for a final vote.

## Co-Benefits

* **Money Stays Local:** Residents spend money at local shops rather than driving to big-box stores outside the city.
* **Better Health:** People walk and bike more, reducing heart disease and pollution-related asthma.
* **Less Loneliness:** Small local shops act as "third places" where neighbors meet and talk.
* **Climate Action:** This is one of the most effective ways to lower carbon emissions from cars.
