## Overview

The "15-Minute City" (or "Complete Neighborhood") concept is a global standard for sustainable urbanism. It aims to create communities where residents can access daily needs—including grocery, pharmacy, education, and recreation—within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. This model reduces car dependency, lowers emissions, and fosters thriving local economies.

While Paris popularized the branding, cities worldwide have implemented rigorous policy frameworks to achieve this vision. This model policy provides case studies, sample legislative language, and implementation steps for municipalities.

## Global Case Studies

### Melbourne, Australia: The "20-Minute Neighbourhood"

**The Policy:**
Melbourne formally integrated this concept into their long-term strategic plan, *Plan Melbourne 2017–2050*. They adopted a "20-minute" metric to account for lower-density suburban contexts, making it highly relatable to North American cities.

**Key Mechanism: The "Hallmarks" Framework**
A neighborhood is not just "zoned" mixed-use; it must meet specific performance criteria:
- **Safe, accessible, and connected:** High walkability scores and safe cycling infrastructure.
- **High-quality public realm:** Access to parks, plazas, and green spaces.
- **Thriving local economies:** Presence of local jobs and retail services.

**Takeaway:** Don't just rezone; create a "performance standard" that developments must meet.

### Portland, Oregon, USA: The "Complete Neighborhoods" Overlay

**The Policy:**
Portland’s Climate Action Plan targets having 90% of residents living in "complete neighborhoods."

**Key Mechanism: The "Urban Center" Overlay**
Instead of rezoning the entire city, Portland identified "Centers" and "Corridors" where density is encouraged.
- **Inclusionary Zoning:** Heavily utilized to require new density to include affordable housing, ensuring the "15-minute" lifestyle is accessible to all income levels.

**Takeaway:** Focus on equity. Explicitly link upzoning to affordable housing requirements to prevent displacement.

### Barcelona, Spain: "Superblocks" (Superilles)

**The Policy:**
A physical infrastructure policy rather than just a zoning one.

**Key Mechanism: Street Reallocation**
The city takes a 3x3 grid of nine city blocks and restricts through-traffic to the perimeter.
- **Interior Streets:** Reclaimed for pedestrians, playgrounds, and markets.
- **Speed Limits:** Reduced to 10km/h (6mph) inside the superblock.

**Takeaway:** Zoning allows buildings to change; Superblocks allow streets to change, creating immediate public space.

## Model Policy Language

The following template language is adapted from standard municipal codes and the "SmartCode" framework.

### A. General Plan (Vision Statement)

**Goal: The 15-Minute Neighborhood Framework**
"The City shall aim to create 'Complete Neighborhoods' where residents can access daily needs—including grocery, pharmacy, elementary education, and public recreation—within a 15-minute walk or bike ride."

**Policy 1.1:**
"The City shall prioritize 'Mixed-Use' designations over 'Single-Use' designations in all future Future Land Use Map (FLUM) amendments."

**Policy 1.2:**
"The City shall align transportation investments to prioritize pedestrian and bicycle connectivity within a 1-mile radius of identified Neighborhood Activity Centers."

### B. Zoning Ordinance (Specific Code)

#### 1. Redefining Permitted Uses (The "Corner Store" Provision)
*Purpose: To allow small-scale, neighborhood-serving retail and service uses within residential zoning districts to promote walkability.*

**Section X.X: Neighborhood Commercial Overlay**

**Permitted Uses:**
The following uses are permitted by right in [Residential Zones R-1, R-2] provided the gross floor area does not exceed 1,500 square feet:
- Coffee shops, bakeries, and delis (without drive-throughs).
- Small grocery or specialty food stores.
- Personal services (barbershops, tailors, dry cleaning drop-off).
- Co-working spaces or professional offices.

**Performance Standards:**
- **Signage:** Restricted to non-illuminated, building-mounted signage not exceeding 10 sq. ft.
- **Hours of Operation:** Limited to 7:00 AM – 9:00 PM to mitigate noise impacts.

#### 2. Reducing Car Dependency (Parking Reform)
*Purpose: To prevent large parking lots from pushing buildings apart and hindering walkability.*

**Section X.Y: Context-Sensitive Parking Requirements**

**Exemption:**
No minimum off-street parking spaces are required for:
- Commercial uses under 2,500 square feet located within 1/4 mile of a transit stop.
- Residential developments of 4 units or fewer (Missing Middle Housing).

**Shared Parking:**
New developments may reduce required parking by up to 40% if a 'Shared Parking Agreement' is established with an adjacent use (e.g., an office sharing parking with a restaurant that operates in the evening).

#### 3. "Live-Work" Zoning Definition
*Purpose: To accommodate post-pandemic work patterns and reduce commute demand.*

**Definition: Live-Work Unit**
"A structure or portion of a structure that combines a residential living space with an integrated work space, principally used by one or more of the residents."

**Regulatory Status:**
Live-Work units shall be considered a residential use for the purposes of density calculations and a commercial use for building safety codes.

**Permitted Activities:**
Professional services, artisan manufacturing, and small-scale retail are permitted by right, provided no hazardous materials or industrial noise are generated.

## Implementation Checklist

For immediate action by City Council or Planning Departments:

1.  **Conduct an "Amenity Audit":**
    - Map current grocery stores, parks, and schools.
    - Identify "food deserts" and "green deserts" (areas >15 min walk from these amenities).

2.  **Pilot a "Flex Zone":**
    - Choose one intersection in a residential area.
    - Rezone it to allow a corner cafe and a co-working space as a pilot program.

3.  **Adopt "Missing Middle" Housing:**
    - Legalize duplexes, triplexes, and ADUs (Accessory Dwelling Units) in single-family zones.
    - This increases the local customer base required to support neighborhood businesses.

## Co-Benefits

- **Economic Resilience:** Keeps spending within the local community and supports small businesses.
- **Public Health:** Increases physical activity through walking and cycling; reduces pollution-related respiratory issues.
- **Social Connection:** Creates "third places" for community interaction, reducing social isolation.
- **Climate Action:** Significantly reduces Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) and associated greenhouse gas emissions.
