## Overview

As transportation electrifies, the primary barrier is no longer the vehicle range, but the ability to charge at home. Retrofitting a completed building is 4-6 times more expensive than installing infrastructure during construction. Furthermore, the rise of e-bikes has created a new safety hazard: "battery fires" in apartments caused by tenants charging unsafe devices in living rooms.

This policy future-proofs the city by ensuring all new buildings are "EV Ready," empowers tenants to install chargers at their own cost, and moves e-bike charging out of apartments and into safe, ground-level facilities.

## Policy 1: The "100% EV Ready" Code (New Construction)

**Concept:**
It is not efficient to install expensive chargers in every spot today. However, it *is* efficient to run the conduit and wiring so that adding a charger later is a "plug-and-play" task, not a construction project.

**The Policy:**
Effective immediately, all **New Construction** (Residential & Commercial) with parking must meet the **100% EV-Ready Standard**:
1.  **Conduit Everywhere:** 100% of parking spaces must have electrical conduit and capacity for a Level 2 (208/240V) connection installed behind the wall.
2.  **Energy Management Systems (EMS):** Buildings must install "Load Management" technology. This allows 100 cars to charge overnight without upgrading the utility transformer by sharing the available power (e.g., slowing down charging when everyone plugs in at 6 PM).

**Real-World Example:**
* **Quebec, Canada:** The province is finalizing a code requiring 100% of parking spots in new multi-family buildings to be EV-ready by 2025. This prevents the "charger lottery" where only a few lucky tenants get spots.

## Policy 2: The "Right-to-Charge" (Tenant Protections)

**Concept:**
Tenants often want to pay for a charger, but landlords or HOAs block them due to apathy or unfounded liability fears. This policy removes the veto power.

**The Policy:**
Landlords and HOAs cannot "unreasonably restrict" a resident from installing an EV charging station in their deeded/assigned parking space, provided the tenant:
1.  **Pays All Costs:** Covers the cost of equipment, installation, and electricity (via sub-metering).
2.  **Uses Licensed Contractors:** Adheres to all safety codes and provides insurance certification.
3.  **Liability Waiver:** Signs an agreement holding the landlord harmless for damage.

**Exemptions:** Landlords are exempt if the building lacks the electrical capacity (and the tenant refuses to pay for the upgrade) or if parking is not assigned.

**Real-World Example:**
* **California, USA (Civil Code 1947.6):** This state law grants tenants the right to install chargers. It successfully unlocked charging for millions of renters by standardizing the legal agreements, so landlords didn't have to hire lawyers for every request.

## Policy 3: Micromobility & Fire Safety (The E-Bike Rules)

**Concept:**
E-bikes are key to the "15-Minute City," but charging lithium-ion batteries in high-rise hallways is a major fire risk. We must treat them as vehicles, not toys.

**The Policy:**
1.  **Ground-Level Storage:** Commercial and Multi-Family buildings >10 units must provide secure, ground-level (or elevator-accessible) bicycle storage rooms. Hauling e-bikes up stairwells is prohibited.
2.  **The "Safety Cabinet" Standard:** Charging rooms must be equipped with:
    * **Fire-Rated Walls:** 1-hour fire resistance rating.
    * **Smart Detection:** Smoke detectors connected to the building's main alarm system.
    * **UL Certification:** Only devices certified by UL (Underwriters Laboratories) may be charged on-premises; non-certified "aftermarket" batteries are banned.

**Real-World Example:**
* **New York City, USA:** Following a spike in deadly battery fires, NYC passed laws banning the sale of uncertified batteries and is retrofitting public housing with safe, outdoor e-bike charging/storage hubs.

## Implementation Roadmap (Phased Approach)

To allow the market to adapt, the policy follows a 3-Phase "Trigger" timeline.

### Phase 1: The "New Build" Gate (Months 1-12)
* **Action:** Update Zoning Code to require "100% EV Ready" for all *new* permit applications filed after Jan 1st.
* **Micromobility:** Ban the sale of non-UL certified e-bike batteries within city limits (retail enforcement).

### Phase 2: The "Right-to-Charge" (Months 12-24)
* **Target:** Large Existing Buildings (>50 units).
* **Action:** "Right-to-Charge" law takes effect. Landlords must respond to tenant requests within 60 days.
* **Support:** City launches a "Model Lease Addendum" template so landlords have a safe legal contract to use.

### Phase 3: The Retrofit & Expansion (Year 3+)
* **Target:** Smaller Buildings (<50 units) and Commercial Retrofits.
* **Incentive:** Launch a "Conduit Rebate" program covering 50% of the cost for older buildings to upgrade their electrical panels to support future chargers.
* **Micromobility:** Mandatory inspections of commercial bike rooms to ensure fire compliance.
