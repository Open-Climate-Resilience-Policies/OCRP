# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! If you know of a climate resilience policy that should be included in this repository, please follow these steps to submit it.

## 1. Find a Policy
Identify a policy, strategy, or regulation that has been implemented or proposed in a jurisdiction. We are looking for policies that are:
- **Effective**: Have a clear impact on climate resilience.
- **Replicable**: Can be adapted by other municipalities or organizations.
- **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in science and best practices.

## 2. Format with AI
To ensure consistency across the repository, we ask that you convert the policy into our standard generic format. You can use an AI tool (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to help with this.

**Prompt Instructions:**
> "Please take the following policy document [INSERT LINK OR TEXT] and convert it into a generic model policy format. Use the following structure:
> - **Title**: A clear, descriptive title.
> - **Summary**: A brief overview of the policy.
> - **Type**: (e.g., Ordinance, Bylaw, Strategy, Standard)
> - **Jurisdiction**: (e.g., City, State, National - or 'Model Policy')
> - **Date Enacted**: (if applicable)
> - **Content**: The full text of the policy, generalized for broader use.
> - **Implementation**: Steps for adopting and implementing the policy.
> - **Resources**: Links to original documents or further reading."

## 3. Submit an Issue
Once you have the formatted Markdown:
1. Go to our [Issue Queue](https://github.com/Open-Climate-Resilience-Policies/OCRP/issues).
2. Click **New Issue**.
3. Provide the **Original Link** or source document.
4. Paste the **Formatted Markdown** into the issue description.
5. We will review, discuss, and decide on including it in the repository.

Thank you for helping build a more resilient future!
