# How to Contribute

We now have two ways to help: add new policies and stress-test the Policy Assistant. Both build a stronger community of practice.

## Track 1: Add or Improve Policies
1) **Find a policy** that is effective, replicable, and evidence-based.
2) **Normalize it to our structure** (title, summary, type, jurisdiction, date, content, implementation, resources).
3) **Open an issue** with the source link and your formatted Markdown: [Issue Queue](https://github.com/Open-Climate-Resilience-Policies/OCRP/issues).

Suggested AI prompt for formatting
> "Convert this policy [INSERT LINK OR TEXT] into a generic model policy. Keep: Title, Summary, Type, Jurisdiction, Date Enacted (if any), Content (generalized), Implementation steps, Resources with source links. Do not invent citations."

## Track 2: Use and Improve the Policy Assistant
The Policy Assistant lives on every policy page (look for the green widget). It helps you craft AI-ready prompts using the page context and your details.

- **Try it on a policy page**: set your role (Activist or Policy Professional), add your context, generate a prompt, and copy it.
- **Share feedback**: open an issue or PR with what worked, what was confusing, and any glitches.
- **Tell us outcomes**: if you use a generated prompt with officials or community members, let us know the response. Real-world feedback helps us tune safeguards and usefulness.

## Community Expectations
- No fabricated data or sources.
- Keep accessibility and privacy in mind—no tracking or hidden dependencies.
- Be specific about what you tested (page URL, role selected, inputs) so we can reproduce issues.

Thank you for helping build a resilient, collaborative community.
