# Community Discussion Guidelines

> **The "No Camps" Rule:** We don't care who you voted for. We care about your citations.

**OCRaP.ai** is an engineering project, not a debating society. We are here to build legislation that works. These guidelines ensure our "Drafting Room" (GitHub Discussions) remains a place for high-signal, low-noise collaboration.

## 1. The Prime Directive: "Attacking the Problem vs. The Person"

* **✅ Encouraged (Red Teaming):**
    * *"This policy fails because the solar irradiation data for Seattle doesn't support the output claims in Section 3."*
    * *(This attacks the math. This is helpful.)*

* **❌ Banned (Campism):**
    * *"This is just more woke nonsense from the anti-car lobby."*
    * *"You clearly hate poor people if you support this."*
    * *(This attacks the motive. This is noise. It will be deleted.)*

## 2. The "Receipts" Rule

If you make a claim, you must provide the "Receipts" (Evidence).

* **Weak:** *"Heat pumps don't work in the cold."*
* **Strong:** *"According to the 2023 study by [Institute Name] (Link), air-source heat pump efficiency drops below COP 1.5 at -20°C. We need a backup heat clause."*

**The AI Integrity Check:**
Our bots may scan your comments. If you post a broken link or a hallucinated study, a bot will flag your comment as `[CITATION NEEDED]`.

## 3. How to Critique (The "Red Team" Protocol)

We *want* you to break our policies. But you must tell us **how** so we can fix them. Use this format:

1.  **The Flaw:** (e.g., "The timeline is impossible.")
2.  **The Evidence:** (e.g., "Supply chain lead time is 12 months.")
3.  **The Fix:** (e.g., "Change implementation date to 2026.")

## 4. The "Localizer" Clause

Remember that **Context is King**.
* Just because a policy works in **Amsterdam** doesn't mean it works in **Atlanta**.
* Do not dismiss someone's concern just because it doesn't apply to *your* city.
* **Use Tags:** When posting, clarify your context: `[Context: Arid/Desert]` or `[Context: Rural Canada]`.

## 5. Conflict Resolution

* **Strike 1:** Warning from a Maintainer.
* **Strike 2:** "Cooling Off" period (24h ban).
* **Strike 3:** Permanent Ban.

**We are building the operating system for a resilient future. Act like an architect.**
