### Batch 2: MEDIUM PRIORITY (9 policies)
Named programs and initiatives with documented case studies.

### Batch 3: LOWER PRIORITY (6 policies)
General frameworks requiring primary research sources.

## Summary Statistics

| Batch | Count | Characteristics | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------------|----------|
| Batch 1 | 12 | Specific laws, explicit data | Start immediately |
| Batch 2 | 9 | Named programs, documented initiatives | Follow Batch 1 |
| Batch 3 | 6 | General frameworks, academic research | Lower urgency |
| **Total** | **27** | | |

---

## Workflow Recommendations

1. **Start with Batch 1** - policies with specific legislation and numbers
2. **Prioritize within Batch 1**: Begin with policies that already include URLs (biodiversity-corridors, geothermal-workforce, food-waste)
3. **Track progress**: Update status for each policy as sources are found
4. **Challenge areas across all batches**:
   - Recent 2024-2025 legislation may lack full documentation
   - International sources may require translation
   - Specific statistics need primary sources
   - "Exploring" or "proposed" examples may not have official documentation

---

## Next Steps

Per AGENTS.md Section 9.5 (AI-Assisted Editing Protocol):
- Cannot fabricate URLs or citations
- Must verify sources exist before adding
- Should create backups before substantial edits (*.bak files in archive/)
- Requires human verification for authoritative sources

**Recommended approach**: Human researcher handles Batch 1 with AI assistance for verification and formatting.
