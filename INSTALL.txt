INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

This project uses Jekyll to generate the static site. The easiest way to run it locally is using Docker, which avoids the need to install Ruby and Jekyll dependencies on your machine.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
1. Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) installed and running.
   - Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

RUNNING LOCALLY
---------------
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd /path/to/OCRP

3. Run the following command to start the server:

   docker run --rm \
     -p 4000:4000 \
     -v "$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
     jekyll/jekyll:4.2.2 \
     jekyll serve --watch --force_polling --host 0.0.0.0

   Note: 
   - On Windows PowerShell, replace "$PWD" with "${PWD}".
   - On Windows Command Prompt, replace "$PWD" with "%cd%".

4. Once the server starts (you'll see "Server running..."), open your browser and go to:
   http://localhost:4000/OCRP/

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- Port Conflict: If you see an error about port 4000 being allocated, check if another container is running:
  docker ps
  docker stop <container_id>

- Platform Warning: On Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs, you might see a platform warning. This is normal and can be ignored.
